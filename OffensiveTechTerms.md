## What to do about common terms that have racist connotations  

Notes on this topic.  I don't know where the content of this file will go.  

In the summer of 2020, after officer Derek Chauvin invested nine minutes and 29 seconds killing George Floyd in public and on camera, social unrest helped some to empathize with [those experiencing a long legacy of violence](https://sayevery.name/) at the hands of police and racist terrorists -- in the context of widespread apathy across United States.  That empathy is expressed across many facets of society, including tech in all its forms.

There are a number of computer engineering terms that evoke racist history, like "master" and "slave" and "whitelist" and "blacklist."
