## What to do about common technology terms that have racist connotations  

Notes on this topic -- I don't know where the content of this file will go.  

In the summer of 2020, after officer Derek Chauvin spent nine nonchalant minutes and 29 seconds killing handcuffed, unarmed and face-down George Floyd in public and on camera, social unrest helped some to empathize with [those experiencing a long legacy of violence](https://sayevery.name/take-action) and countless other injustices at the hands of police and others.  For too long this occurred in the context of widespread apathy across United States and beyond.  This new thread of empathy is expressed across many facets of society, including tech in all its forms.  

There are a number of computer engineering terms that evoke racist history, like "master" and "slave" and "whitelist" and "blacklist."  Their use can be painful to some and discourage their participation in and their advancement in tech.  There are alternatives -- see the excellent [RFC Draft by Mallory Knodel and Niels ten Oever](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-knodel-terminology/?include_text=1) on this topic.  A few examples for illustration:  

Area                 | Legacy | Suggestion(s) |
--------------------:|:------:|:--------------|
Source code control|master|main|
Database|master|source, primary|
Database|slave|replica|
Validation|whitelist|allowlist, permitlist|
Validation|blacklist|denylist|
Pipeline(Jenkins?)|master|controller|
Pipeline(Jenkins?)|slave|agent or worker|
Firewall(IPTables?)|blacklist|denylist|
Firewall(IPTables?)|whitelist|permitlist, allowlist|



When we use metaphors, we use terms regarded as representative or symbolic of the real target of our attention.  We expect that the reader/listener will understand the literal meaning of our term and then be able to map that understanding to the present context.  If we use hurtful or exclusionary terms as metaphors we devalue those harmed populations.  This equation is not required.  We are not prisoners of inertia.  Language matters.  Carefully, sensitively, reviewing our use of metaphor seems like a prudent practice in business -- where successful collaboration and marketing demand positive relationships and where brand & image are foundational.  It seems like the-right-thing-to-do in the rest of our lives as well.  

We cannot, though, depend on businesses to just do-the-right-thing.  In most business contexts, this will require policies, incentives, and leadership.  It seems practical for businesses to create actionable policy regarding problematic language (*some already have a start in place*).  For most, this will not be easy.  But it will not advance until it starts.  And even then it will require an ongoing process, not just a static publication.  


#### QUOTES:  
Kate Conger (2021-04-13) Some of their databases were called “masters” and were surrounded by “slaves,” which received information from the masters and answered queries on their behalf, preventing them from being overwhelmed. Others used “whitelists” and “blacklists” to filter content.  

Charles M. Blow (2021-05-02) "And the precise way we phrase the statement makes all the difference: America's systems — like its criminal justice, education and medical systems — have a pro-white/anti-Black bias, and an extraordinary portion of America denies or defends those biases."

* Treating each other with empathy & compassion is essential for well-functioning business & the broader society, but governors and legislatures in Republican-controlled states across the country have been attempting to define limits on race-related ideas and limits on raising certain race-related ideas in the context of everything under their control/direction in ways that may apply to dealing with 'offensive tech terms' and much more.  In the year following the killing of George Floyd, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia have enacted laws (or that process is well along) limiting speach about race in ways that appear to weaponize '*ideas about race and society*' which they intend to assist their 2022 campaigns.  Republican leaders in Utah, Georgia, Montana, and North Carolina have also been successful in similar actions via other means.  Hold up your investments to remove hurtful or exclusionary terms from your tech environment as a concrete example of resistance to these efforts to suppress justice and further divide society.
