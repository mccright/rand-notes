# Quantum Computing Resources  

Because of how Internet enablement extends across much of modern business, much of what we do depends on effective (i.e., *good-enough*) encryption.  At some point quantum computers (or quantum computing cloud services) will be able to *break* many/most industry standard encryption implementations.  For high-value and/or high-sensitivity use cases -- think financial services or unique intellectual property -- that presents a number of *future* risks.  Based on my experience in global financial services, re-tooling encryption implementations throughout an enterprise infrastructure and operations to achieve a risk-relevant level of quantum-resilience would currently be a gigantic, expensive effort (*if not simply impractical*) of material duration (*years, not months*).  With whose givens, it would not be risk-appropriate to wait -- expecting to treat the arrival of that "*quantum-threat*" as a crisis.  It is equally risk-inappropriate to *just hope* that quantum-resilient encryption will *appear* and be *easy* to integrate into your environment(s).  

Investors, and later, regulators, will also be interested in every organization's quantum-resilience.  If *responsible management* is not the right motivator, consider losing the ability to finance operations or growth, or to be penalized by your regulator(s) for quantum readiness sloth.  

### Learning About Quantum Computing  
Here are some resources to learn more about this topic:  
* Open-Source Quantum Development.  Qiskit [quiss-kit] is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and application modules. (*Python 3.7+ in a virtual environment with Anaconda*) [quiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/)  
* IBM Quantum Lab [https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab)  
* "Qiskit Textbook" -- It is really a broad (*comprehensive?*) course on the topic [https://qiskit.org/learn/](https://qiskit.org/learn/)
