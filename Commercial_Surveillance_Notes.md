### Rough, unfinished, work notes on this topic

For years I have been reading about how Internet enabled activities have evolved into a complex global *organism* that closely monitors, observes, analyzes, and monitizes our behaviors.  Those practices have enabled a parallel *prediction* industry to *add value* to that surveillance data.  

#### Who is actually doing this business?  
* These notes are in support of a still-vaguely-imagined recreational software project that would make some of information about Internet surveillance vendors available via API, browser, or both.  

#### Who might care?  
* Forensic technicians and blue teams.  
* Developers interested in writing applications in ways that *share*/*expose* less data associated with their users.  
* Those interested in reducing their exposure to data collectors and scavengers.  
* Those interested in reducing the effectiveness of AI-driven personalized maniplation.  
* Those interested in open source projects that involve scraping web sites.  
* Those interested in helping women (*and those who support them*) protect their reproductive rights.[Note1]()  
* And more.  

#### This is not a new issue:  
Bruce Schneier (5 years ago):  "Surveillance is the business model of the internet. Everyone is under constant surveillance by many companies, ranging from social networks like Facebook to cellphone providers. This data is collected, compiled, analyzed, and used to try to sell us stuff. Personalized advertising is how these companies make money, and is why so much of the internet is free to users. We’re the product, not the customer."  [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/08/when-it-comes-to-internet-privacy-be-very-afraid-analyst-suggests/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/08/when-it-comes-to-internet-privacy-be-very-afraid-analyst-suggests/)  

#### Some Terms:  
* "**surveillance advertising**" -- [Characterized by Leigh Freund](https://thenai.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NAI-Comments-re-Petition-for-Rulemaking-to-Prohibit-Surveillance-Advertising_26Jan22.pdf), President and CEO, Network Advertising Initiative (NAI): "tailored advertising is a key driver of the robust and competitive digital media marketplace that provides substantial benefits to consumers, publishers and advertisers."  Simple observation leads me to believe that *surveillance advertising* technologies and operations are designed and implemented to shape markets and business models.  
* "**Dark patterns**" -- Data-driven techniques intentionally used to mislead or manipulate users, obscuring, subverting or impairing consumer autonomy, decision-making, or choice.  An implication of this common definition is that the end result of the manipulation is a harmful or undesirable outcome for the user.  Advertisers and their advocates promote analogies with practices used in the physical world like product placement by a retailer to promote certain products over others which they characterize as consistent with the objectives and preferences of its shoppers.  
* "**notice and choice**" -- The [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) promotes](https://thenai.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/15march2021.pdf) a *notice and choice* framework "within the digital advertising marketplace, and to enable people to make informed decisions -- both initially and with persistence -- about the use of their data for advertising purposes."  Vendors and human tracking companies appear to use a fog of ever-evolving technology, long piles of text and interlinked *policy* statements (too often opaque to *normal* people) to enable these *informing* obligations.  Then they characterize these behaviors as models of "*clarity, efficiency and effectiveness*."
