### Economic Impacts of Climate Change  
"Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970–2019)." By the World Meteorological Organization, 2021 (page 8) [WMO-No. 1267](https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10989), published in a number of languages: [https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=21930](https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=21930)  
>"According to CRED EM-DAT, from 1970 to 2019 there were 22,326 disasters that met their criteria for recording.  These reported 4,607,671 deaths and US$ 4.92 trillion in economic losses (Figure 1).
>An analysis of the EM-DAT records indicates that 62% of all recorded disasters, 80% of all deaths and almost all (99%) economic losses were associated with natural hazards.  
>Of the 22,326 disasters, 11,072 have been attributed to weather, climate and water hazards. These disasters resulted in 2.06 million deaths and US$3.64 trillion in losses. Thus, over the last 50 years, 50% of all recorded disasters, 45% of related deaths and 74% of related economic losses were due to weather, climate and water hazards."

* Forest fire management deserves more attention.  Trees in forests store large amounts of carbon that can be released when they burn, adding to climate change.  The [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reported](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/wildfires-wreaked-havoc-2021-cams-tracked-their-impact) that wildfires last year emitted the equivalent of about 8.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide (*that is the same volume of CO2 emissions from [all energy combustion and industrial processes globally in 1959](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021)*). That is as much as 22% of global CO2 emissions from coal, oil and other energy sources [(36.3 billion tons) recorded in 2021 by the International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2021-2).

>"In a severe scenario of a 3.2°C temperature increase, China stands to lose almost one quarter of its GDP (24%) by mid-century. The US, Canada and the UK would all see around a 10% loss. Europe would suffer slightly more (11%), while economies such as Finland or Switzerland are less exposed (6%) than, for example, France or Greece (13%)."

### Random Action  

#### Use Only What You Need  
Avoiding energy (*or other*) consumption is the best practice.  It can deliver quick results...  
* Andrea Stanley wrote an [interesting essay about light, light pollution, and light tresspassing](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/realestate/light-pollution-effects.html) where she argued that we use too much light without thinking enough about our intended goals.  She concludes that this results in a broad range of negative impacts -- which include material amounts of wasted energy (*citing a 2022 U.S. DoE report on "[Solid-State Lighting R&D Opportunities](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/2022-ssl-rd-opportunities.pdf)"*).  

#### Treat Big Oil and Big Ag Like Big Tobacco  
* Fossil fuel, big ag and their enablers knew years ago that their businesses damaged earth and drove climate change. But they invested heavily in climate denial, disinformation, and deception campaigns against climate action for decades to protect their profits and influence.  Their tactics included counterfeit science, harassment of scientists, manufactured uncertainty with no scientific basis, and influence campaigns aimed at political decision makers and career civil servants.  They left communities to pay the price.  Union of Concerned Scientists [https://www.ucsusa.org/climate/disinformation](https://www.ucsusa.org/climate/disinformation) and The Center for Climate Integrity [https://climateintegrity.org/](https://climateintegrity.org/).  Here is an illustration of our experience with how fatal and climate-damaging coal-fired electricity generation has been relative to widely available alternatives [https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth) and the bar chart alone at [https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/11/5-Bar-chart-%E2%80%93-What-is-the-safest-form-of-energy-1536x827.png](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/11/5-Bar-chart-%E2%80%93-What-is-the-safest-form-of-energy-1536x827.png)  

#### Force More Accurate Pricing for Fossil Fuels and Other Petrochemicals  
* We have been subsidizing the petrochemical industry by allowing them to abondon as many as [3.2 million oil and gas wells](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c02234) after they stop 'producing' enough to meet the industry's short term profit goals.  These sites '*leak*' dangerous substances into the atmosphere, the ground, and water sources -- resulting in enormous negative economic and social impacts.  [Some estimate](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/file-uploads/OrphanWells_CGEP-Report_071620.pdf) that 3.2 million abondoned wells would emit more than 500,000 metric tons of methane per year.  The U.S. has allowed the petrochemical industry to discount and walk away from their obligation of, the costs of 'cleaning up' millions of oil and gas well sites around the country.  Recently, [the U.S. government has begun to fund abondoned well cleanup](https://apnews.com/article/biden-travel-new-orleans-climate-and-environment-bbe808df98e65085eda9018b32cac29a).  Forcing all those involved in the oil and gas location, extraction, production, transmission, and distribution to include the full life-cycle costs of their materials (including cleaning up all oil and gas well sites) would help to more accurately represent the economic load these industry participants (and their investors) impose on us.  It would also help drive more accurate pricing for their products and make 'cleaner' alternatives more attractive.
