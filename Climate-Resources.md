Random Action  
* Fossil fuel, big ag and their enablers knew years ago that their businesses damaged earth and drove climate change. But they invested heavily in climate denial, disinformation, and deception campaigns against climate action for decades to protect their profits and influence.  Their tactics included counterfeit science, harassment of scientists, manufactured uncertainty with no scientific basis, and influence campaigns aimed at political decision makers and career civil servants.  They left communities to pay the price.
