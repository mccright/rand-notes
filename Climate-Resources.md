# Climate Change Reading:  

### Climate Change and Global Warming was a Topic for Serious Sciences More than 40 Years Ago  
In 1980, I ran across a used pamphlet - ["Worldwatch Paper 21: Soft Technologies, Hard Choices" by Colin Norman](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED156566.pdf), published a couple years earlier in June 1978.  I was in college at the time and understood that its content was important, and kept that little booklet -- reading it again from time to time.  It was written when our nation still quaked from what Norman called "the Arab oil embargo" and its demonstration of how fragil were the industrial world's petroleum-based economies.  Part of his argument was that humanity needed to implement major energy conservation and to invent/implement new energy generation & transmission technologies to avoid a predicted carbon dioxide-induced global warming catastrophy.  On page 31 Mr. Norman began an explanation of the growing concern "that carbon dioxode -- an inevitable by-product of burning fossil fuels -- is building up in the atmosphere and acting rather like a greenhouse, preventing a fraction of the earth's heat from being radiated into space."  He went on, "The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is already (*as he wrote those words in 1978!*) believed to have risen by about 13 percent since the Industrial Revolution, and it may double over the next 50 years.  Such a change could increase the average temperatures on the earth's surface by 2-3 degrees C." He then summarized the predicted impacts "In general, global warming would bring increased rainfall and probably cause local weather patterns to become more variable."  And then:  
>A more worrying possibility is that global warming could have an adverse impact on the stability of the polar ice caps. ...(*and*) over the next 50 years could raise polar temperatures by an amount sufficient to cause the West Antarctic ice sheet to break up.  Such an event would raise the average sea level by about five meters, which would be catastrophic for many low-lying areas.  

Sea ice covered 26.8 million kilometers² when I originally read that pamphlet in 1980 and covers no more than 21.1 million kilometers² as I write this sentence in 2023 (*a reduction of roughly 21%*) and its lowest level in the satellite record (using data from the [National Snow and Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index)).  It is also [hotter](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-september-2023)...  The global average temperature for November 2022 to October 2023 was at least 1.32 degrees Celsius above a pre-industrial baseline, [Climate Central reported 8 Nov 2023](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/earths-hottest-12-month-streak-2023).  
[Copernicus](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-october-2023) reported that:  
>October 2023 was the warmest October on record globally, with an average surface air temperature of 15.30°C, 0.85°C above the 1991-2020 average for October and 0.40°C above the temperature of the previous warmest October, in 2019. The global temperature anomaly for October 2023 was the second highest across all months in the ERA5 dataset, behind September 2023. **The month as a whole was 1.7°C warmer than an estimate of the October average for 1850-1900, the designated pre-industrial reference period.**  
This was not unique, Copernicus reported that 2023 also had the [warmest November](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-november-2023) on record globally and the [warmest December](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-december-2023) on record globally.  

This "*ancient history*" only represents carbon-driven climate warming activity at a given point in `my` lifetime.  [Thomas Alex recently reminded](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2023/12/07/climate-change-warnings-greta-thunberg-carl-sagan-al-gore/71829461007/) me that before my grandparents were born, [Svante Arrhenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius) (1859-1927), who won the Nobel Prize in 1903, used the principles of physical chemistry to estimate the extent to which increases in the atmospheric carbon dioxide were responsible for the Earth's increasing surface temperature.  Scientific investigation of human-driven climate change has been around for more than a century -- with serious and sustained scientific focus for more than half a century.  Resist the people and organizations who still market climate denial, disinformation, and deception campaigns against climate action (*Jessica Guynn reported in early 2024 that the owners of Twitter/X, Facebook and TikTok have de-emphasized the importance of resisting climate denial, disinformation, and deception across their social media ecosystems, and [their behaviors have resulted in material increases in climate misinformation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2024/01/19/climate-change-denial-spreading-social-media/72257689007/)*).

### Human-Driven Warming is Here Now, and Needs Our Attention  
A key message of the 5th Annual U.S. National Climate Assessment [released on November  14, 2023](https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/) is that future climate change impacts depend on choices made today:  
>The effects of human-caused climate change are already far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United States. Rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions can limit future warming and associated increases in many risks. Across the country, efforts to adapt to climate change and reduce emissions have expanded since 2018, and US emissions have fallen since peaking in 2007. However, without deeper cuts in global net greenhouse gas emissions and accelerated adaptation efforts, severe climate risks to the United States will continue to grow.  

The "[National Climate Assessment](https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/front-matter/)" is a report on climate change impacts, risks, and responses. It is a [congressionally mandated](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/169/text) U.S. government interagency effort that provides the scientific foundation to support informed decision-making across the United States.  

The United Nations Environment Programme "[Emissions Gap Report 2023](https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2023)"  
>Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again) finds that the world is heading for a temperature rise far above the Paris Agreement goals unless countries deliver more than they have promised. The report is the 14th edition in a series that brings together many of the world’s top climate scientists to look at future trends in greenhouse gas emissions and provide potential solutions to the challenge of global warming.  



Change will not be easy in part because there are [around eight billion humans on Earth today](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/900), each needing/consuming resources and generating more or less greenhouse gasses (*this is about twice the world population when I was born, and consumption/carbon emissions are wildly unevenly distributed across this population -- introducing fairness issues as we ask given sub-populations to change*).

### Too Many of Us Have Delayed Necessary Change  
We have recently been releasing heat-trapping carbon dioxide (*and other greenhouse gases*) into the atmosphere [faster than at any time in at least the past 50 million years](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/20/opinion/ancient-trees-climate-change.html) resulting in profound climate change.  Based on relatively undiciplined reading, it seems like only the sum of immediate, intense individual and collective action can deflect the current trajectory of increasing global suffering (*or worse*).  

Unfortunately, AP's [Cathy Bussewitz reported recently](https://apnews.com/article/climate-emissions-global-warming-carbon-dioxide-coal-494ef490f16abe381ea2a4107f779670) that we (*humanity*) are not reflecting that urgency:  
>"Communities around the world emitted more carbon dioxide in 2022 than in any other year on records dating to 1900, a result of air travel rebounding from the pandemic and more cities turning to coal as a low-cost source of power.  Emissions of the climate-warming gas that were caused by energy production grew 0.9% to reach 36.8 gigatons in 2022, the International Energy Agency [reported Thursday](https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-in-2022). (The mass of one gigaton is equivalent to about 10,000 fully loaded aircraft carriers, according to NASA.)"  

* Dr. Zeke Hausfather (climate research lead at the payments company Stripe and a research scientist at [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/), an independent organization that analyzes environmental data) argues in October 2023 that data continues to show the rate of climate warming continues to accellerate: [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/climate-change-excessive-heat-2023.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/climate-change-excessive-heat-2023.html), supported by Robert Rohde's report at: [https://berkeleyearth.org/september-2023-temperature-update/](https://berkeleyearth.org/september-2023-temperature-update/)

### Economic Impacts of Climate Change  
"Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970–2019)." By the World Meteorological Organization, 2021 (page 8) [WMO-No. 1267](https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10989), published in a number of languages: [https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=21930](https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=21930)  
>"According to CRED EM-DAT, from 1970 to 2019 there were 22,326 disasters that met their criteria for recording.  These reported 4,607,671 deaths and US$ 4.92 trillion in economic losses (Figure 1).
>An analysis of the EM-DAT records indicates that 62% of all recorded disasters, 80% of all deaths and almost all (99%) economic losses were associated with natural hazards.  
>Of the 22,326 disasters, 11,072 have been attributed to weather, climate and water hazards. These disasters resulted in 2.06 million deaths and US$3.64 trillion in losses. Thus, over the last 50 years, 50% of all recorded disasters, 45% of related deaths and 74% of related economic losses were due to weather, climate and water hazards."

* Forest fire management deserves more attention.  Trees in forests store large amounts of carbon that can be released when they burn, adding to climate change.  The [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reported](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/wildfires-wreaked-havoc-2021-cams-tracked-their-impact) that wildfires last year emitted the equivalent of about 8.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide (*that is the same volume of CO2 emissions from [all energy combustion and industrial processes globally in 1959](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021)*). That is as much as 22% of global CO2 emissions from coal, oil and other energy sources [(36.3 billion tons) recorded in 2021 by the International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2021-2).

(*[Helaine Olen summarizing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/04/vicki-robin-profile-your-money-your-life-anniversary-fire/) some of Viki Robin's teaching*)  Avoiding energy (*or other*) consumption is the best practice.  It can deliver quick results...  
* Andrea Stanley wrote an [interesting essay about light, light pollution, and light tresspassing](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/realestate/light-pollution-effects.html) where she argued that we use too much light without thinking enough about our intended goals.  She concludes that this results in a broad range of negative impacts -- which include material amounts of wasted energy (*citing a 2022 U.S. DoE report on "[Solid-State Lighting R&D Opportunities](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/2022-ssl-rd-opportunities.pdf)"*).

* Fossil fuel, big ag and their enablers knew years ago that their businesses damaged earth and drove climate change. But they invested heavily in climate denial, disinformation, and deception campaigns against climate action for decades to protect their profits and influence.  Their tactics included counterfeit science, harassment of scientists, manufactured uncertainty with no scientific basis, and influence campaigns aimed at political decision makers and career civil servants.  They left communities to pay the price.  See supporting work by the Union of Concerned Scientists [https://www.ucsusa.org/climate/disinformation](https://www.ucsusa.org/climate/disinformation) and The Center for Climate Integrity [https://climateintegrity.org/](https://climateintegrity.org/).  Here is an illustration of our experience with how fatal and climate-damaging coal-fired electricity generation has been relative to widely available alternatives [https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth) and the bar chart alone at [https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/11/5-Bar-chart-%E2%80%93-What-is-the-safest-form-of-energy-1536x827.png](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/11/5-Bar-chart-%E2%80%93-What-is-the-safest-form-of-energy-1536x827.png).

Exxon's position was to "emphasise the uncertainty in scientific conclusions" about the greenhouse effect](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64241994?s=09).  
>On the basis of company records, we quantitatively evaluated all available global warming projections documented by -- and in many cases modeled by -- Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003. We find that most of their projections accurately forecast warming that is consistent with subsequent observations. Their projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models. Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp also correctly rejected the prospect of a coming ice age, accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected, and reasonably estimated the "carbon budget" for holding warming below 2°C. On each of these points, however, the company's public statements about climate science contradicted its own scientific data.

* U.S. Republicans shill for Big Oil.  For example, the [Conservative Climate Foundation](https://www.rightonclimate.org/) paid for members of the Republican [Conservative Climate Caucus](https://curtis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1961) -- U.S. Reps. John Curtis (R-Utah), Garret Graves (R-LA), Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), and **Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa)** -- to [present some of Big Oil's "*clean oil*" stories](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20221113&goTo=A010&artid=0) as a panel at the [COP27 U.N. Climate Summit](https://unfccc.int/COP27), in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on 2022-11-11.  At the [final scheduled session of the day](https://www.state.gov/u-s-center-at-cop27/schedule-and-events/program/) (4:00-5:00pm local time) these four elected representatives presented "Conservative Solutions to Global Climate Challenges: A Robust U.S. Energy, Climate and Conservation Agenda," moderated by Rich Powell, professional energy adviser to Washington D.C. policymakers, co-chair of the "[Conservative Climate Foundation](https://www.rightonclimate.org/)," CEO of [ClearPath](https://clearpath.org/about-us/rich-powell/) and FoxNews contributor.  They appear focused on *removing roadblocks to extracting, consuming and exporting American oil/natural gas and coal.*  They promoted a range of ideas -- carbon capture being hot in 2022-2023.  They mentioned some *techy* and *sciency* topics, but [their behaviors all seemed to be about increasing earnings/profits through the extraction, consumtion and exporting of American oil/natural gas](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-false-promise-of-carbon-capture-as-a-climate-solution/) and coal (*with a nod to U.S. ethanol producers via Iowa's Miller-Meeks*).  Sprinkling some legitemately useful energy items did not eliminate the tone of their presentations.  This thread of Big Oil-funded activity only leads to higher levels of CO2 along with greater damage to earth and all who inhabit it.  It also helps to create a fog of ideas that support the status quo and serve to obscure and disrupt efforts to deal with climate change dangers on a relevant time-scale.  
* This is not a new idea:  
  * [Fred Krupp (Environmental Defense Fund) argued in 2014](https://www.edf.org/media/statement-edf-president-fred-krupp-colorado-breaks-new-ground-addressing-oil-and-gas-air) that leakage of methane throughout the natural gas supply chain, including during production activities -- *methane is at least 28 times more powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over the longer term and at least 84 times more potent in the near term* -- along with large-scale volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions make natural gas just as bad an energy source as coal...

By [Naomi Oreskes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Oreskes) and [Erik M. Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_M._Conway), 2010 -- which argues that spreading doubt and confusion is the foundational strategy of Big Oil's efforts opposing actions that might help diminish the negative impacts of human-induced climate change.

Jan. 11, 2023.  Ms. Hiroki documents how "The Propane Education and Research Council, or PERC, which is funded by propane providers across the country, has spent millions of dollars on "provocative anti-electrification messaging" for TV, print and social media, using influencers." Propane is derived from fossil fuels and emits planet-warming greenhouse gases like its cousins, coal, gasoline or diesel. "In 2023, the organization plans to spend $13 million on its anti-electrification campaign, including $600,000 on "influencers"...in order to "combat the growing narrative that fossil fuel combustion is the main cause of climate change, and that propane is a dirty fossil fuel."  PERC also invests millions of dollars in lobbying against climate legislation -- including with misleading disinformation about the efficiency of heat pumps in Northern climates. "In 2022, for example, PERC committed nearly $900,000 to a New York propane industry group to address the "massive challenge from well-funded efforts to electrify the entire state" — namely, to fight policies stemming from New York's 2019 climate law which, among other goals, aims to ensure that buildings and vehicles stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2040."

#### Force More Accurate Pricing for Fossil Fuels and Other Petrochemicals  
* We have been subsidizing the petrochemical industry by allowing them to abondon as many as [3.2 million oil and gas wells](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c02234) after they stop 'producing' enough to meet the industry's short term profit goals.  These sites '*leak*' dangerous substances into the atmosphere, the ground, and water sources -- resulting in enormous negative economic and social impacts.  [Some estimate](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/file-uploads/OrphanWells_CGEP-Report_071620.pdf) that 3.2 million abondoned wells would emit more than 500,000 metric tons of methane per year.  The U.S. has allowed the petrochemical industry to discount and walk away from their obligation of, the costs of 'cleaning up' millions of oil and gas well sites around the country.  Recently, [the U.S. government has begun to fund abondoned well cleanup](https://apnews.com/article/biden-travel-new-orleans-climate-and-environment-bbe808df98e65085eda9018b32cac29a).  Forcing all those involved in the oil and gas location, extraction, production, transmission, and distribution to include the full life-cycle costs of their materials (including cleaning up all oil and gas well sites) would help to more accurately represent the economic load these industry participants (and their investors) impose on us.  It would also help drive more accurate pricing for their products and make 'cleaner' alternatives more attractive.  
* Big Oil and ethanol plant operators (*and unethical investors*) are attempting to build out carbon-capture infrastructure **by tapping into billions of dollars in federal support**. Pipeline companies in the U.S. mid-west want *massive* federal payments available to those who transport carbon dioxide from ethanol, fertilizer and other energy-intensive industries by mixing huge amounts of it with toxic *proprietary* solutions, liquifying it, using high pressure to drive it hundreds or thousands of miles, and then pumping those poisons deep under ground.  To do so they need to build extensive pipeline networks across a number of mid-western states and get permissions to "*store*" the toxic waste underground.  That "*storage*" is a euphemism for [flooding a previously-pumped oil/gas field with the CO2+toxin mixture in order to flush out much of the remaining oil](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-false-promise-of-carbon-capture-as-a-climate-solution/) -- which is sometimes shortened to simply "[enhanced oil recovery](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/enhanced-oil-recovery)."  They preach that this activity has a single-minded focus on contributing to its net-zero emissions goal by 2050 -- for example, review the sessions at the [November 8-9, 2022 National Carbon Capture Conference](https://2022-nccc.bbiconferences.com/ema/DisplayPage.aspx?pageId=Agenda1).  These actors do not appear to invest time/effort into analyzing their efforts in the context of the broader carbon and energy life-cycles.  Their operations enable increasing gas/oil extraction (new carbon) and add **a lot** of energy consumption to every industry process they service and they create new environment-polluting processes and new streams of toxic waste along the way.  The "federal support" and the distribution of new costs across a range of carbon-emitters (*heavy with petrochemicals*) and the state and local governments where they operate appear as *background noise* in promotion of carbon capture concepts and the science and technology deployed in its service.  All of this effort seems like it is in service of Big Oil and the status quo.  


#### Call Out Climate Deniers/Skeptics/Provocateurs  
* Invest enough effort in reviewing the outputs of these threads of **doubt-provoking** activity to understand their data selections, logic and conclusions.  (*Examples of this work incorporates *real* facts/observations to give their theories, assertions, and conclusions the ring of objective science*.)  Then if the author's mission appears to be focused on creating "*alternatives*" to broadly-established science, make your observations known in your social and professional circles, and consider writing reviews of the work for publication.  

An example of this category (*alternative* "science") might be the "[Climate Change Reconsidered series](https://climatechangereconsidered.org/climate-change-reconsidered-ii-fossil-fuels/)" outputs from the [Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC)](https://climatechangereconsidered.org/about-the-nipcc/) and [The Heartland Institute](https://climateconferences.heartland.org/) which build their narratives & conclusions on "*research overlooked or ignored by*" more objective scientists involved in climate change research.  

#### What can we measure and report that might be immediately relatable to non-scientists?  
Climate deniers/skeptics/provocateurs often use some version of a "word soup" or "acoustic salad" designed and delivered to sow doubt, confusion or concern about messaging from *real* climate scientists and honest climate advocates.  What types of data might be most immediately understandable and relatable to non-scientists?  Here are a few from the [U.S. National Climate Assessment](https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/front-matter/).
