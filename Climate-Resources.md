# Climate Change Reading:  

* See the most up-to-date physical understanding of the climate system and climate change - latest data and interpretations: [https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/)  
 * The latest *Synthesis Report* and supporting research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will dribble out throughout 2022 [https://www.ipcc.ch/ar6-syr/](https://www.ipcc.ch/ar6-syr/)  Since the IPCC was created in 1988, there have been 5 Synthesis Reports, see links to that historical reporting on this page as well.

Economic Impacts of Climate Change  
>"According to CRED EM-DAT, from 1970 to 2019 there were 22,326 disasters that met their criteria for recording.  These reported 4,607,671 deaths and US$ 4.92 trillion in economic losses (Figure 1).
>An analysis of the EM-DAT records indicates that 62% of all recorded disasters, 80% of all deaths and almost all (99%) economic losses were associated with natural hazards.  
>Of the 22 326 disasters, 11,072 have been attributed to weather, climate and water hazards. These disasters resulted in 2.06 million deaths and US$3.64 trillion in losses. Thus, over the last 50 years, 50% of all recorded disasters, 45% of related deaths and 74% of related economic losses were due to weather, climate and water hazards."

Random Action  
* Fossil fuel, big ag and their enablers knew years ago that their businesses damaged earth and drove climate change. But they invested heavily in climate denial, disinformation, and deception campaigns against climate action for decades to protect their profits and influence.  Their tactics included counterfeit science, harassment of scientists, manufactured uncertainty with no scientific basis, and influence campaigns aimed at political decision makers and career civil servants.  They left communities to pay the price.
