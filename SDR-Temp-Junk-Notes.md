***Hardware: NESDR SMArt***  
Part of a new NooElec NESDR SMArt Bundle (Premium RTL-SDR w/ Aluminum Enclosure, 0.5PPM TCXO, SMA Input & 3 Antennas. RTL2832U & R820T2-Based, plus, re-designed antenna base, and 3 antenna masts).

I plugged in the device (Fedore 27) and it worked perfectly.  
  
SpyServer from: https://airspy.com/download/  
Then set up the Pi as an SDR streaming server: https://eliaselectronics.com/rtlsdr/2014/11/19/raspi-rtl-streaming-server.html

N.B. Testing and analysis has shown that the elements should be slightly more than one wavelength long ( WL x 1.0443 ).
The factors to use are:  31329 / F (centimeters) or 12334 / F (inches) long.

Driver 'ohci-...' means it is USB 1.1 interface.  
Driver 'uhci-...' also means USB 1.1.  
USB 2.0 uses 'ehci-...' driver.   
USB 3.0 must use 'xhci_...' driver?  
I've read that some have addressed problems having this symptom by switching the IOMMU option to "enabled" (or the  "iommu=soft" option) and boot option to "legacy only."  Do I need to do that for this SDR hardware?

When the setting is y, it is built in the kernel, when set to m, it is a loadable module.
