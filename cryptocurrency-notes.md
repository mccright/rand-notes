# Cryptocurrency Notes  

*This is just a scratchpad for now*.  
...since its emergence in 2008/9, digital currency has existed outside of government and traditional banking/financial services controls and constraints, and depends on tight integration with public [distributed ledgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) called [blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) or [*Distributed Ledger Technology* (DLT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp) (decentralized, immutable, encrypted, tokenized, distributed, consensus-building and record-keeping).  It has also depended on lots of venture capital (*and civilian investor*) funding.  There are at least [four types of blockchain networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Types) today: public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains. Public (*sometimes called "permissionless"*) blockchains support some of the most popular cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and have several components that enable them to transfer value without relying on trusted third parties -- [a research paper by the NY Fed examines these components](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/08/what-makes-cryptocurrencies-different/).  

My reading and experience in the financial services industry leads me to believe that for much of their short lifetime, cryptocurrencies, blockchain/DLT and an ecosystem of '*So, you wanted to use it?*' technology have been pumped using hyper-positive myths that attempt to define them as a magical, safe, inherently egalitarian, democratic, decentralized and anonymity-protecting utopia.  

[Dr. Mihir A. Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihir-desai-8246a0119/), a professor at [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6585) and [Harvard Law School](https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/mihir-a-desai/), [recently described these crypto myths](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/opinion/the-crypto-collapse-magical-thinking-capitalism.html) as '*magical thinking*' that:  
* Crypto will replace governments  
* Crypto will supplant traditional currencies  
* Crypto enables you to reject the traditional banking and financial system through decentralized finance  
* Crypto enables you to reject the power of internet giants on commerce through something called Web 3.0.  
* With Crypto you can reject the traditional path toward success of education, savings and investment by getting in early on one or another ______ coin that will go from nothing to tens of billions...  

Investopedia condenses this marketing to: *cryptocurrency* [makes it easier for people to create decentralized applications. Additionally, it was created to remove third parties from global financial systems and transfer monetary control to the people instead of governments and businesses.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ether-cryptocurrency.asp).  

I assume that the industry is populated with lots of good people and good ideas, but facts documented by *the blockchain* itself show a reality that "*currency*" generation and ownership (*i.e., market power*) has regularly been highly centralized among a small elite (*analogous to the legacy financial world*), and that anonymity is difficult to achieve and harder to maintain.  There seem to be a relatively high concentration of predatory actors in the cryptocurrency marketplace.  And there have been a lot of losses that were (*at least in part*) caused by flawed technology, business implementations and operations, as well as by sophisticated criminals and hucksters/hypesters/grifters (*for a high profile example: Donald Trump [recently announced](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/16/donald-trump-supported-world-liberty-financial-raises-just-4-of-token-sale-target-on-first-day/) his family’s own cryptocurrency company, [World Liberty Financial](https://worldlibertyfinanciai.com/) -- [Trump is described publically as the company's "chief crypto advocate," his sons Eric and Donald Jr. are described as "web3 ambassadors," and Barron called its "DeFi visionary"](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/trump-familys-world-liberty-finance-token-sale-appears-to-go-live-selling-220m-wlfi-in-minutes/) -- selling a non-transferable $WLFI coin that is [impossible to trade unless the company's rules are modified in the future](https://decrypt.co/286381/trump-world-liberty-financial-site-crashes-token-sale) and is available only to non-U.S. citizens and to accredited U.S. investors.*).  The primary *value* in *cryptocurrency-world* seems to be its ability to suck hard currency (*and other traditional financial instruments*) from the legacy *real* money-handling world -- and there seems to be *virtually* no other sources of profit except for the torrent of fees and sales of services that wrap the crypto universe and its operations.  For example see the disclaimer on [Trump's WLF site](https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/):
>"None of Donald J. Trump, any of his family members or any director, officer or employee of the Trump Organization, DT Marks DEFI LLC or any of their respective affiliates is an officer, director, founder, or employee of World Liberty Financial or its affiliates. None of World Liberty Financial, Inc., its affiliates or the World Liberty Financial platform is owned, managed, or operated, by Donald J. Trump, any of his family members, the Trump Organization, DT Marks DEFI LLC or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, or principals. $WLFI tokens and use of the World Liberty Financial platform are offered and sold solely by World Liberty Financial or its affiliates. DT Marks DeFi, LLC and its affiliates, **including Donald J. Trump has or may receive approximately 22.5 billion tokens from World Liberty Financial, and will be entitled to receive significant fees for services provided to World Liberty Financial, which amount cannot yet be determined**. World Liberty Financial and $WLFI are not political and not part of any political campaign."  
  

Eswar Prasad, a professor in the Dyson School at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and the author of The Future of Money, [wrote in August 2024](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/opinion/crypto-2024-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Bk4.G_xJ.1u5t9ihLhxY1&smid=url-share) that:  
>"One major paradox of crypto is that there is now enormous centralization in this unregulated ecosystem. Apparently unwilling to put their full faith in a trustless technology, most users rely on cryptocurrency exchanges to hold their crypto assets and to trade them.  The fraud perpetrated by Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, in which its executives treated investor funds like a personal piggy bank, highlights this vulnerability. And the government’s charges that Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, engaged in money laundering and other forms of malfeasance show how the problems of concentrated market power can pervert the noble aims of crypto visionaries."  
>"The process by which transactions are validated and recorded on the Bitcoin digital ledgers is [controlled by a handful of major consortiums](https://hashrateindex.com/hashrate/pools) that deploy their computing power to enable this process and [reap the rewards](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/bitcoin-block-reward-block-size-block-time-whats-the-difference).

[Quote about cryptocurrencies from Paul Krugman](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/27/opinion/tesla-stock-elon-musk.html):
>Despite years of effort, nobody has yet managed to find any serious use for cryptocurrency other than money laundering.  

[Quote about illicit cryptocurrency activity in 2022 from the most optimistic perspective by chainanalysis.com](https://go.chainalysis.com/2023-crypto-crime-report.html)  
>Despite the market downturn, illicit transaction volume rose for the second consecutive year, hitting an all-time high of $20.6 billion. We have to stress that this is a lower bound estimate — our measure of illicit transaction volume is sure to grow over time as we identify new addresses associated with illicit activity...  (*Note: this $20B U.S. does not include the billions lost in criminal activity that led to the failure of numerous cryptocurrency companies in 2022, nor ChainAnalysis' updated estimate for 2022... $39.6 billion.*)  
Followed by their [report on Crypto Crime in 2023](https://go.chainalysis.com/crypto-crime-2024.html):  
>"2023 saw a significant drop in value received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses, to a total of $24.2 billion. As always, we have to caveat by saying that these figures are lower bound estimates based on inflows to the illicit addresses we’ve identified today. One year from now, these totals will almost certainly be higher, as we identify more illicit addresses and incorporate their historic activity into our estimates. For instance, when we published our Crypto Crime Report last year, we estimated $20.6 billion worth of illicit transaction volume for 2022. One year later, our updated estimate for 2022 is $39.6 billion. Much of that growth came from the identification of previously unknown, highly active addresses hosted by sanctioned services, as well as our addition of transaction volume associated with services in sanctioned jurisdictions to our illicit totals." (*pages 3-4*)  

A recent example of an all too typical DeFi scam: Oliver Knight [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/04/22/zkasino-users-plead-for-refunds-as-33m-of-bridged-ether-sent-to-lido/) that cryptocurrency casino ZKasino promoted a story that investors could use a ZKasino-managed "token bridge that allowed them to deposit ether (ETH) to earn ZKAS, the platform’s native token," promising "that bridged ether would be “returned” once the bridging period was over," then, the scam was revealed, "...that wording has since been removed," and "ZKasino wrote that “all bridged ethereum has been converted to our native gas token, ZKAS, at a discounted rate of $0.055.”"  In the process, investors *lost* control of $33 million worth of ETH.  There were *warnings* about ZKasino [staffing](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1731025316204745113) and [technology](https://twitter.com/0xCygaar/status/1782043339744809044), and it appears that these *investments* were [converted](https://coin360.com/news/zkasino-controversy-exit-scam-allegations) into [g(*r*)ifts](https://twitter.com/slavikinvestor/status/1783234297765167300)... (*distant echos of FTX?)  

Some U.S. regulators want cryptocurrencies regulated as commodities -- without any of the "*know your customer*" requirements associated with financial instruments.

It’s backed by no government, is all but impossible to use and serves no legal need."  


* Alyssa Blackburn and collaborators used data leakage from the bitcoin blockchain to identify the activities of *anonymous* individuals over 2 years -- finding that most bitcoin was mined by only sixty-four agents, exhibiting extensive resource centralization and material cooperation among that small group: [https://aidenlab.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://aidenlab.org/bitcoin.pdf) and also see an article about her work: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/science/bitcoin-nakamoto-blackburn-crypto.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/science/bitcoin-nakamoto-blackburn-crypto.html)  


Some of the cryptocurrency hype has been [exploited by grifters](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/business/crypto-do-kwon-terraform-labs.html).  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) analyzed complaints related to crypto-assets submitted to the CFPB and [reported in late 2022](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/complaint-bulletin-analysis-of-consumer-complaints-related-to-crypto-assets/) that "fraud, theft, hacks, and scams are a significant problem in crypto-asset markets, as are transaction problems, including frozen accounts and inability to access assets."

Crypto-scams and theft appear in ways that are common in the *real world.*  

Do Kwon was arrested for a range of charges from South Korea and the U.S. in what appear to be [*crypto-using* **fraud** schemes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/23/do-kwon-crypto-arrest/).  

Cryptocurrency hype has been used by [scammers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam) in *crypto-using* **[Ponzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme)** schemes.  For example, on [11 May 2022](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv03822/579698) the [U.S. Dept. of Justice charged EminiFX, owned by Eddy Alexandre](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ceo-cryptocurrency-and-forex-trading-platform-charged-fraudulent-scheme-involving-over) of New York (*[who had twice filed for bankruptcy -- in 2017 and in 2019](https://www.cftc.gov/media/7246/enfeminifxcomplaint051122/download)*), with ["commodities fraud and wire fraud offenses,"](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ceo-cryptocurrency-and-forex-trading-platform-charged-fraudulent-scheme-involving-over) using Ponzi scheme techniques and behaviors beginning in October 2021.  EminiFX and Alexandre claimed the company had developed a proprietary trading system that would invest customer’s money in cryptocurrency and the foreign exchange markets to generate at least 5% per week (*which would double a user's money within five months of their original investment*).  The initial Receiver's report [[page 21](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf)] (filed 2022-07-22) said that by May 2022 there were 62,000 EminiFX user accounts, whose trading wallets were valued in the EminiFX platform as U.S. $512M, while the receiver's forensic accountants valued those wallets at around U.S. $170M [[page 24](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf)].  EminiFX was operated around an assumption that multilevel marketing (where people *earn* bonuses for recruiting others) was the primary driver of customer growth.  Withdrawals were discouraged.  Users who had participated in EminiFX for less than 150 days (which meant most of them) were charged a 15% withdrawal fee [[page 25](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf)] and the payment of all withdrawals had to be personally approved by Alexandre [[page 25](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf)].  EminiFX and Alexandre claimed that their investing *success* was based on their "secret" Robo Assisted Adviser Account ("RA3") -- which the receiver found no evidence ever existed [[page 26](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf)].  The receiver found only two categories of investment activity by EminiFX.  The first was in Alexandre’s personal brokerage account, which was funded in with just over $9 million almost exclusively in funds that are clearly traceable to EminiFX corporate accounts, and which experienced "consistent and significant" losses -- valued at less than $2 million at the time the Receiver was appointed [[page 26](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf)].  The second involved contracts to purchase 46 residential properties in foreclosure auctions (U.S $2.3M in deposits) and 2 more not in foreclosure (U.S. ~200K deposit) obligating the company to pay U.S. $24M for the purchases (*EminiFX went into receivership before making that payment*) [[page 26](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf)].

"Insomnia, addiction, depression: The dark side of life trading crypto -- Crypto was going to make them rich. Instead, therapists say, more people became depressed and addicted." By Pranshu Verma. 2022-04-29 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/29/crypto-addiction/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/29/crypto-addiction/)  
>"As the cryptocurrency (*trading*) boom has swollen the ranks of everyday investors chasing a life of mansions and yachts, mental health experts say it is sparking a rise in addiction. Price spikes and dips provide a level of excitement hard to replicate through the most volatile stocks and bonds. The highly unstable nature of cryptocurrency can reduce profits to zero in a flash, leaving investors with mountains of debt, fractured relationships and thoughts of suicide, addiction experts said."  
>"Cryptocurrency (*trading*) has characteristics that make it more prone to addiction than sports betting, gambling and traditional financial investing, according to addiction scholars. Crypto can be traded around-the-clock, unlike most stocks. People don’t need to drive to a casino to invest in a coin. The volatility in crypto prices, especially alternative currencies like meme coins, can be quick and provide the brain quick feelings of reward. And given crypto’s decentralized nature, it can be easier to hide the financial impacts of addiction."

The asset class has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past week." By Tory Newmyer and Steven Zeitchik, 2022-05-12. Stablecoin which aims to keep its price at $1, has been falling for a week --  TerraUSD (aka 'UST') was priced as low as 30 cents on Wednesday May 11 and was trading around 40 cents Thursday evening May 12, 2022. By June 9, 2022, UST seemed to have *stabilized* at around 10 cents, or one tenth of the value *promised* by stablecoin hypesters.  In the last eight months Bitcoin is down 59% (*"an estimated 40 percent of bitcoin holders are underwater on the asset"*) and Ethereum is down 60%.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/12/crypto-crash-terra-national-bitcoin/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/12/crypto-crash-terra-national-bitcoin/)  
 


### How does Bitcoin have value?  
Different parties answer this question in a variety of ways.  CoinBase has what is a pretty standard cryptocurrency industry slant.  It makes the normal pokes at humans in *governments* creating new currency (*devaluing yours*), along with a series of assertions about security that are only *true* if you ignore the *real world* where an *attack surface* reality matters and where sentient beings can choose alternate mental models/framing and attack from that perspective.  
Copied From [https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin](https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin) on 2022 June 9.  
>Bitcoin’s value is inspired by properties such as:  
>    * A fixed and predictable monetary supply. Unlike fiat currency  (government-backed money), new Bitcoin cannot be created suddenly or by the trillions by any elected or unelected official. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.  
>    * Bitcoin operates by open-source code and is globally transparent, unlike fiat currency. At any time, anyone can independently verify the total Bitcoin supply and its underlying code, as well as the balances of each account on the global ledger.  
>    * Bitcoin is secured by cutting-edge encryption, and is backed by immense amounts of energy. If an individual or organization were to try to undermine Bitcoin’s core encryption, it would require impossible amounts of energy, specialized computers, and space. Bitcoin is the most secure computing network in the world.  
>    * Unlike traditional bank accounts, anyone, anywhere can connect to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is an uncensorable and global network for transacting value.  
>So long as the above properties are useful to people across the world, Bitcoin will have value.  

[At midnight on 14 Sept 2022 Ethereum completed its switch ("the merge")](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/technology/ethereum-merge-crypto.html) from "proof-of-work" to a more energy-efficient "proof-of-stake" with the goal of reducing its energy consumption by more than 99 percent -- and, hopefully, reducing transaction fees (gas).  If this is a durable change, then some of the risk management provided by the "*impossible/immense amounts of energy*" mentioned above may be traded away for a reduction in infrastructure and operations expenses.

### A few recent high profile failures/crypto-hype grifts  

#### Three Arrows Capital  
* "[US Bankruptcy Judge Freezes Crypto Hedge Fund Three Arrows Capital's Assets](https://news.bitcoin.com/us-bankruptcy-judge-freezes-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capitals-assets/)" by Kevin Helms. "Judge Martin Glenn, a United States bankruptcy judge for the Southern District of New York, granted an emergency motion Tuesday (*2022-07-12*) to freeze the remaining assets of bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC)..."  The judge noted that the physical whereabouts of Three Arrows Capital co-founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies are "currently unknown."  
* "[Three Arrows Capital falls into liquidation after crypto crash](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/29/three-arrows-liquidation-crypto/)." By Hamza Shaban, Updated June 29, 2022   
Three Arrows Capital had not made the required payments on a loan worth more than $665 million, paid partly in bitcoin.  
...
The Financial Times reported that Three Arrows Capital had failed to meet demands from lenders to show extra funds after its wagers on crypto had gone bust.  
https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/court-orders-liquidation-of-three-arrows-crypto-fund/  
* "Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows fails to meet lender margin calls." https://www.ft.com/content/126d8b02-f06a-4fd9-a57b-9f4ceab3de71  
Among Three Arrows' big bets was luna, the sister token to the algorithmic stablecoin terra. Both imploded in May, going to zero, a market- shattering event that turned what had been months of steady declines in crypto prices into a more dramatic rout.  
#### BlockFi  
* [BlockFi](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/01/from-one-to-zero-blockfis-fire-sale-shows-the-uber-startup-model-is-disastrous-for-finance/)  In the face of serious solvency issues, BlockFi s After accumulating [$1.3B U.S. in funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockfi-inc), BlockFi appears to have sold itself to **[FTX](https://ftx.com)** for $240M or less in what appears to be a material loss for customers and lenders.  

#### Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX et. al.  
* The **[FTX](https://ftx.com)** cryptocurrency trading exchange unraveled beginning (*in public, at least*) the week of 2022-11-06.  Part of the concerns driving the FTX implosion were associated with the [business, financial, and accounting practices of Sam Bankman-Fried's](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/) crypto ecosystem (*another implementation of age-old "deception and fraud"*).  On 2022-11-10 [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com) removed a long, positive [profile of Sam Bankman-Fried from their corporate site](https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/ftx/) where he *bragged* that [he never read books -- books being for losers...](https://archive.ph/Yg64e#selection-1695.320-1707.251) (*see: [Molly Roberts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/29/sam-bankman-fried-reading-effective-altruism/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried) on this topic*).  The [Financial Times wrote](https://www.ft.com/content/f05fe9f8-ca0a-48d5-8ef2-7a4d813af558) on Friday 2022-11-11 that FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. -- and CNBC followed up with reporting that FTX had only [$900 million in "easily sellable assets" against $9 billion of liabilities](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/12/sam-bankman-fried-reportedly-denies-fleeing-to-argentina-says-hes-still-in-the-bahamas.html).  Then, late on Friday 2022-11-11, credible reports said that FTX accounts were being robbed and [more than $600 million](https://twitter.com/web3isgreat/status/1591359590578298880) was taken -- even though a [bright red banner across the top of some ftx.com web pages](https://ftx.com/ftt) said, "FTX is currently unable to process withdrawals. We strongly advise against depositing. Deposits of TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, and HT are disabled."  [Reporting on the 12th](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/12/ftx-crypto-hack/) said that (*at least some of*) the accounts used in the theft(s) were being identified.  Maybe the theft (*aka "unauthorized transactions"*) was **only** [$400 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/11/12/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-demise/), or [$515 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/12/ftx-crypto-hack/).  Or maybe that level of detail hardly matters when FTX was valued in January 2022 at [$32 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/31/crypto-exchange-ftx-valued-at-32-billion-amid-bitcoin-price-plunge.html) and this week told the bankrupcy court that they had roughly $900 million in useful assets...  Grift at this scale seems to be a feature of the *cryptoverse* -- not a bug.  On [2022-11-17 David Yaffe-Bellany wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/business/ftx-bankruptcy.html) that:  
>The collapse has jeopardized the savings of hundreds of thousands of customers who deposited their crypto holdings on the FTX platform. FTX had a wide reach across cryptocurrency companies, and its collapse has sent shock waves through the industry. Last week, the crypto lender BlockFi — a firm that was closely linked to Mr. Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire — said that it was suspending operations. On Wednesday, the crypto firm Genesis announced that its own lending arm was halting withdrawals.

Sam Bankman-Fried (*founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, and now [often compared to Bernie Madoff, who executed the largest Ponzi scheme in history](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-bahamas.html)*) was arrested in the Bahamas on 2022-12-12 after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges (*wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering*).  See the [Wikipedia discussion of the charges against SBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried#Arrest_and_charges).  
In [testimony before U.S. House Financial Services Committee](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-rayj-20221213.pdf) John Ray (*now CEO, FTX Debtors*), who oversaw the Enron scandal disassembly/cleanup in 2001, said:  
>Although our investigation is ongoing and detailed findings will have to await its conclusion, **the FTX Group’s collapse appears to stem from the absolute concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company that is entrusted with other people’s money or assets**.  
A jury found Sam Bankman-Fried guilty of stealing $8 billion from customers, more specifically, of seven wire fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges (*with a combined maximum sentence of 110 years*). At the highest level, Bankman-Fried, through his companies FTX and Alameda Research, lied and stole as he pumped up the price of a token having no real value and used that inflated valuation to *support* the business’s balance sheets and to borrow dollars. Finally, [on 28 March 2024, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison and was "also ordered to forfeit $11.2 billion in assets."](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/technology/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced.html?ugrp=u&unlocked_article_code=1.gE0.LlhV.sgytURwMHNrW&smid=url-share) (*what seems like a [light sentence for theft at this scale](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/technology/sam-bankman-fried-white-collar-sentences.html)*).

[https://youtu.be/TQ7g7kZUmX0](https://youtu.be/TQ7g7kZUmX0)  
By [late January 2023, the U.S. Justice department had identified roughly U.S $700 million in accounts linked to Sam Bankman-Fried](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/20/us-seizes-170-million-ftx/) and had already seized some of it.  These were '*real U.S. currency*' accounts, not crypto (circle back to *SBF the grifter* and his aparent distain for FTX crypto *customers*).

If after all that, you still think it is important to invest (*cough... "gamble"*) in cryptocurrencies, there are ways to do so via more effectively regulated markets (*you might start with a [Morningstar search](https://www.morningstar.com/search?query=crypto)*), or consider doing so via [one or another cryptocurrency ETF](https://etfdb.com/etfs/currency/cryptocurrency/?search[inverse]=false&search[leveraged]=false#etfs__overview&sort_name=assets_under_management&sort_order=desc&page=1), sometimes also called a crypto-based exchange-traded products or "ETP."  Again, as with any investment, think it through before spending any money -- according to [Crypto Fund Research](https://cryptofundresearch.com/about/) fees can be as high as 22% - [2023 Q4 Crypto Fund Report](https://cryptofundresearch.com/q4-2023-crypto-fund-report/):  
>"A 2% management fee and 20% incentive/performance fee (2/20) is the most common fee structure among crypto funds. However, the average fees across all funds tend to be lower and vary slightly between fund types. Index and other passive strategies often don't charge a performance fee, while funds with more active investment strategies tend to have higher performance fees (and sometimes lower management fees)."
