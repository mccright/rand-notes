# Cryptocurrency Notes  

*This is just a scratchpad for now*.  
...since its emergence in 2008/9, digital currency has existed outside of government and traditional banking controls and constraints, and depends on tight integration with public ledgers called blockchains or [*Distributed Ledger Technology* (DLT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp) (decentralized, peer-to-peer record-keeping).  

My reading and experience in the financial services industry leads me to believe that for much of their short lifetime, cryptocurrencies and blockchain/DLT technology have been pumped using hyper-positive myths that attempt to define them as a safe, inherently egalitarian, democratic, decentralized and anonymity-protecting utopia.  I assume that the industry is populated with lots of good people and good ideas, but facts documented by *the blockchain* itself show a reality that "*currency*" generation and ownership (*i.e., market power*) has regularly been highly centralized among a small elite (*analogous to the legacy financial world*), and that anonymity is difficult to achieve and harder to maintain.  There seem to be a relatively high concentration of predatory actors in the cryptocurrency marketplace.  And there have been a lot of losses that were (*at least in part*) caused by flawed technology and business implementations and operations.  The primary *value* in *cryptocurrency-world* seems to be its ability to suck *real* hard currency (*and other real financial instruments*) from the traditional money-handling world -- and there seems to be no other sources of profit.   (*unfinished thoughts here...*)  

Some U.S. regulators want cryptocurrencies regulated as commodities -- without any of the "*know your customer*" requirements associated with financial instruments.

* Alyssa Blackburn and collaborators used data leakage from the bitcoin blockchain to identify the activities of *anonymous* individuals over 2 years -- finding that most bitcoin was mined by only sixty-four agents, exhibiting extensive resource centralization and material cooperation among that small group: [https://aidenlab.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://aidenlab.org/bitcoin.pdf) and also see an article about her work: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/science/bitcoin-nakamoto-blackburn-crypto.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/science/bitcoin-nakamoto-blackburn-crypto.html)  


Some of the cryptocurrency hype has been exploited by grifters in *crypto-using* Ponzi schemes.  For example, on [11 May 2022](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv03822/579698) the [U.S. Dept. of Justice charged EminiFX, owned by Eddy Alexandre](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ceo-cryptocurrency-and-forex-trading-platform-charged-fraudulent-scheme-involving-over) of New York (*[who had twice filed for bankruptcy -- in 2017 and in 2019](https://www.cftc.gov/media/7246/enfeminifxcomplaint051122/download)*), with ["commodities fraud and wire fraud offenses,"](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ceo-cryptocurrency-and-forex-trading-platform-charged-fraudulent-scheme-involving-over) using Ponzi scheme techniques and behaviors beginning in October 2021.  EminiFX and Alexandre claimed the company had developed a proprietary trading system that would invest customer’s money in cryptocurrency and the foreign exchange markets to generate at least 5% per week (*which would double a user's money within five months of their original investment*).  The initial Receiver's report [page 21](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf) (filed 2022-07-22) reported that by May 2022 there were 62,000 EminiFX user accounts, whose trading wallets were valued in the EminiFX platform as U.S. $512M, while the receiver's forensic accountants valued those wallets at around U.S. $170M [page 24](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf).  EminiFX was operated around an assumption that multilevel marketing (where people *earn* bonuses for recruiting others) was the primary driver of customer growth.  Withdrawals were discouraged.  Users who had participated in EminiFX for less than 150 days (which meant most of them) were charged a 15% withdrawal fee [page 25](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf) and the payment of all withdrawals had to be personally approved by Alexandre [page 25](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf).  EminiFX and Alexandre claimed that their investing *success* was based on their "secret" Robo Assisted Adviser Account (“RA3”) -- which the receiver found no evidence ever existed [page 26](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf).  The receiver found only two categories of investment activity by EminiFX.  The first was in Alexandre’s personal brokerage account, which was funded in with just over $9 million almost exclusively in funds that are clearly traceable to EminiFX corporate accounts, and which experienced "consistent and significant" losses -- valued at less than $2 million at the time the Receiver was appointed [page 26](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf).  The second involved contracts to purchase 46 residential properties in foreclosure auctions (U.S $2.3M in deposits) and 2 more not in foreclosure (U.S. ~200K deposit) obligating the company to pay U.S. $24M for the purchases (*EminiFX went into receivership before making that payment*) [page 26](http://strettodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/files/e61f824e-e16a-487b-acb8-eb6a8e019094/3aadbc6e-d798-4df0-a366-954f41600da3.pdf).  Participants in this Ponzi scheme (*which sometimes called itself itself an "investing club"*) are likely to receive a fraction of their *investment*...

"Bitcoin has the yearly carbon footprint equivalent to the Czech Republic while producing as much annual electronic waste as the Netherlands."  In 2021, "Bitcoin has the same power consumption as Thailand over the course of the year.

"Insomnia, addiction, depression: The dark side of life trading crypto -- Crypto was going to make them rich. Instead, therapists say, more people became depressed and addicted." By Pranshu Verma. 2022-04-29 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/29/crypto-addiction/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/29/crypto-addiction/)  
>"As the cryptocurrency (*trading*) boom has swollen the ranks of everyday investors chasing a life of mansions and yachts, mental health experts say it is sparking a rise in addiction. Price spikes and dips provide a level of excitement hard to replicate through the most volatile stocks and bonds. The highly unstable nature of cryptocurrency can reduce profits to zero in a flash, leaving investors with mountains of debt, fractured relationships and thoughts of suicide, addiction experts said."  
>"Cryptocurrency (*trading*) has characteristics that make it more prone to addiction than sports betting, gambling and traditional financial investing, according to addiction scholars. Crypto can be traded around-the-clock, unlike most stocks. People don’t need to drive to a casino to invest in a coin. The volatility in crypto prices, especially alternative currencies like meme coins, can be quick and provide the brain quick feelings of reward. And given crypto’s decentralized nature, it can be easier to hide the financial impacts of addiction."

The asset class has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past week." By Tory Newmyer and Steven Zeitchik, 2022-05-12. Stablecoin which aims to keep its price at $1, has been falling for a week --  TerraUSD (aka 'UST') was priced as low as 30 cents on Wednesday May 11 and was trading around 40 cents Thursday evening May 12, 2022. By June 9, 2022, UST seemed to have *stabilized* at around 10 cents, or one tenth of the value *promised* by stablecoin hypesters.  In the last eight months Bitcoin is down 59% (*"an estimated 40 percent of bitcoin holders are underwater on the asset"*) and Ethereum is down 60%.

### How does Bitcoin have value?  
Different parties answer this question in a variety of ways.  CoinBase has what is a pretty standard cryptocurrency industry slant.  It makes the normal pokes at humans in *governments* creating new currency (*devaluing yours*), along with a series of assertions about security that are only *true* if you ignore the *real world* where an *attack surface* reality matters and where sentient beings can choose alternate mental models/framing and attack from that perspective.  
Copied From [https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin](https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin) on 2022 June 9.  
>Bitcoin’s value is inspired by properties such as:  
>    * A fixed and predictable monetary supply. Unlike fiat currency  (government-backed money), new Bitcoin cannot be created suddenly or by the trillions by any elected or unelected official. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.  
>    * Bitcoin operates by open-source code and is globally transparent, unlike fiat currency. At any time, anyone can independently verify the total Bitcoin supply and its underlying code, as well as the balances of each account on the global ledger.  
>    * Bitcoin is secured by cutting-edge encryption, and is backed by immense amounts of energy. If an individual or organization were to try to undermine Bitcoin’s core encryption, it would require impossible amounts of energy, specialized computers, and space. Bitcoin is the most secure computing network in the world.  
>    * Unlike traditional bank accounts, anyone, anywhere can connect to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is an uncensorable and global network for transacting value.  
>So long as the above properties are useful to people across the world, Bitcoin will have value.
