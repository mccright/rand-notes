## Trump's Crimes Related to Government Documents  


### Four Main Indictments Against Trump  
1. **Washington D.C.: Federal case on obstruction in the 2020 election.** [Trump faces four federal charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/01/trump-indicted-jan-6-overturn-2020-election-results) for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. (*trial scheduled to start 2024-03-04*)  
2. **Georgia: State case on obstruction in the 2020 election** [Trump faces 13 state charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/14/trump-indictment-georgia-election-2020), with prosecutors alleging that he tried to undo the election results in that state. (*trial of two defendants are scheduled to start 2023-10-23*)  
3. **Florida: Federal classified-documents case.** [Trump faces 40 federal charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/27/trump-carlos-deoliveira-classified-indictment) over accusations that he kept top-secret government documents at Mar-a-Lago — his home and private club — and then thwarted government demands that he return them.(*trial scheduled to start 2024-05-20*)  
4. **New York: State business fraud case involving a hush money payment in the 2016 election.** [Trump faces 34 state charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/30/trump-ny-indictment) in connection with hush money paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign. (*trial scheduled to start 2024-03-26*)  


* In the classified documents case that Smith has also brought against the former president in June, the Trump team has sought to slow-walk the schedule for the proceedings. There were hints of a similar strategy in the first hearing in the election subversion case.
* [Federal prosecutors allege](#Ref8) that Trump "was determined to remain in power" after losing the election and that he and others orchestrated a plot to reverse the nation's voters' decision, which led up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.

Markings show that some documents pertained to foreign intelligence surveillance and information gathered by human intelligence sources. Some were not to be shared with foreign entities, and others were marked “ORCON,” meaning that the agency that originated the document had to approve any dissemination beyond the government entities approved to see it.

Trump [posted on his social media platform](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111055889871199166) just after midnight (EST) 2023-09-13 that Putin -- who has a history of persecuting his political opponents -- essentially agrees with him.  "[Throughout his term, Trump heaped praise on Mr. Putin, and at one point, during a 2018 summit in Helsinki, professed to trust the Russian leader more than his own intelligence services,](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/world/europe/putin-trump-musk.html)," and as recently as January 2023 Trump said that "[he had been right to trust the Russian president more than U.S. intelligence and F.B.I. “lowlifes.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/world/europe/putin-trump-musk.html)." “My instinct at the time was that we had really bad people,” [he added, rallying off the names of several former top FBI officials he routinely targets](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-trusts-putin-us-intelligence_n_63d83eb5e4b0c8e3fc80087d).  ["Trump has continued to maintain that he and Putin are on good terms"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/09/13/trump-putin-election-interfence/), [claiming in March 2023 that he could resolve Russia's war against Ukraine in a day if he were president](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-ukraine-war-hannity_n_6423c5f8e4b0002361637745).  This is despite the isolation of Putin by the West for his illegal invasion of Ukraine, leading the murder of tens of thousands of Ukrainians — which Trump [once described](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/22/trump-reacts-putins-invasion-ukraine-exactly-youd-expect) as “genius” and “savvy.”    |Trump still promotes Putin's murderous authoritarianism over American liberal democracy.  |

This is a new facet of the government's case against the former president. |[It appears](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/10/trump-classified-documents-motive/) to show that the government has material evidence about **why** Trump illegally took and retained classified U.S documents. |

|[2023-10-19](#Ref10) | Sidney Powell, co-defendant with Donald Trump in the Georgia election conspiracy case, plead guilty and agreed to testify in future trials. Powell played a central role in the conspiracy as an election lawyer who baselessly claimed widespread election fraud in 2020.  She was part of Trump’s inner circle of 2020 election denial leaders. She was at strategic meetings, part of important conversations, and she met in-person with Trump at the White House, including on Dec. 18, 2020, to discuss, among other topics, having the military seize voting machines in certain specific counties and "re-running" their elections. She was also involved in tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.  |If she follows through and testifies honestly at her co-compirator's trials, this could be a material threat to Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and others.

He also agreed to truthfully testify in the case against others.  Chesebro was the architect of a plan to use fake Trump electors in Georgia and other key states to replace legitimate 2020 electoral college votes for Biden -- disrupting and delaying the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021 and violating the rules in the Electoral Count Act, with the goal of swinging the election to Trump. |If he follows through and testifies honestly at his co-compirator's trials, this could be a material threat to Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and others.

Trump has sometimes [insisted that he had issued a “standing order” to declassify papers and that any he brought home were automatically declassified](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/20/us/politics/pence-trump-classified-documents.html).  But former Vice President Pence said on [ABC’s “This Week”](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-8-20-23-former-vice-president/story?id=102386116) “I was never made aware of any broad-based effort to declassify documents.” Eighteen former Trump administration officials -- including three of Trump's chiefs of staff -- [previously told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/politics/trump-claim-standing-order-declassify-nonsense-patently-false-former-officials/index.html) that they knew of no such order either.  
>“There is a process that the White House goes through to declassify materials,” [Mr. Pence added](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/20/us/politics/pence-trump-classified-documents.html). “I’m aware of that occurring on several cases over the course of our four years. But I don’t have any knowledge of any broad-based directive from the president. But that doesn’t mean it didn’t occur; it’s just not something that I ever heard about.”  
During [an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/21/trump-i-could-declassify-documents-by-thinking-about-it-00058212), Trump said the president “can declassify just by saying it’s declassified, even by thinking about it.”  
Trump knew his public assertions about *declassification* were lies -- admitting his knowledge of declassification constraints during a recorded July 2021 interview with individuals working on Mark Meadows’ memoir, Mr. Trump shared plan documents for candidate attacks against Iran and said: “See, as president, I could have declassified it... Now I can’t, you know, but this is still a secret.”

>"Based on these repeated meetings and statements, the evidence shows that an agreement to enact the electoral count plan likely existed between President Trump and Dr. Eastman.." (page 37)  
>"President Trump continuing to push (*the electoral count*) plan despite being aware of its illegality constituted obstruction by “dishonest” means under § 371." (page 38)  "The evidence also demonstrates that Dr. Eastman likely knew that the plan was unlawful." (page 38) ..."Dr. Eastman admitted more than once that “his proposal violate[d] several provisions of statutory law,”255 including explicitly characterizing the plan as “one more relatively minor violation” of the Electoral Count Act." (page 38)  
>"The evidence shows that Dr. Eastman was aware that his plan violated the Electoral Count Act. (page 39)  
>"Dr. Eastman’s views on the Electoral Count Act are not, as he argues, a “good faith interpretation” of the law; they are a partisan distortion of the democratic process. His plan was driven not by preserving the Constitution, but by winning the 2020 election: [Dr. Eastman] acknowledged that he didn’t think Kamala Harris should have that authority in 2024; he didn’t think Al Gore should have had it in 2000; and he acknowledged that no small government conservative should think that that was the case. Dr. Eastman also understood the gravity of his plan for democracy—he acknowledged “[y]ou would just have the same party win continuously if [the] Vice President had the authority to just declare the winner of every State.”"(page 39)  
>"Based on the evidence, the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021."

(page 40)  

Judge Carter concluded that  
>"Dr. Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history. Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower—it was a coup in search of a legal theory. The plan spurred violent attacks on the seat of our nation’s government, led to the deaths of several law enforcement officers, and deepened public distrust in our political process." (page 44)  ... " If Dr. Eastman and President Trump’s plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself." (page 44)

>The Defendant lost the 2020 presidential election.  
>for more than two months following election day on November 3, 2020, the Defendant spread lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won. These claims were false, and the Defendant knew that they were false. But the Defendant repeated and widely disseminated them anyway—to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger, and erode public faith in the administration of the election.  
>(*Defendant's attempts to*) formally challenge the results of the election through lawful and appropriate means...to change the outcome in any state through recounts, audits, or legal challenges were uniformly unsuccessful.  
>Shortly after election day, the Defendant also pursued unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results. In so doing, the Defendant perpetrated three criminal conspiracies: a. A conspiracy to defraud the United States by using dishonesty, fraud, and deceit to impair, obstruct, and defeat the lawful federal government function by which the results of the presidential election are collected, counted, and certified by the federal government, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; b. A conspiracy to corruptly obstruct and impede the January 6 congressional proceeding at which the collected results of the presidential election are counted and certified (“the certification proceeding”), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(k); and C. A conspiracy against the right to vote and to have one’s vote counted, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241.  Each of these conspiracies — which built on the widespread mistrust the Defendant was creating through pervasive and destabilizing lies about election fraud — targeted a bedrock function of the United States federal government: the nation’s process of collecting, counting, and certifying the results of the presidential election (“the federal government function’).  
>Purpose of the Conspiracy: The purpose of the conspiracy was to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election by using knowingly false claims of election fraud to obstruct the federal government function by which those results are collected, counted, and certified.  

The Defendant’s Co-Conspirators  
https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/01/doj-trump-indictment-trump-coconspirators/  
The Defendant enlisted co-conspirators to assist him in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power. Among these were.  
a. Co-Conspirator 1, an attorney who was willing to spread knowingly false claims and pursue strategies that the Defendant’s 2020 re-election campaign attorneys would not. (Rudy Giuliani)  
b, Co-Conspirator 2, an attorney who devised and attempted to implement a strategy to leverage the Vice President’s ceremonial role overseeing the certification proceeding to obstruct the certification of the presidential election. (John Eastman)  
C Co-Conspirator 3, an attorney whose unfounded claims of election fraud the Defendant privately acknowledged to others sounded “crazy.” Nonetheless, the Defendant embraced and publicly amplified Co-Conspirator 3’s disinformation. (Sidney Powell)  
d. Co-Conspirator 4, a Justice Department official who worked on civil matters and who, with the Defendant, attempted to use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud. (Jeffrey Clark)  
e Co-Conspirator 5, an attorney who assisted in devising and attempting to implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding. (Kenneth Chesebro)  
f. Co-Conspirator 6, a political consultant who helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding. (A political consultant)

##### Businesses have found a broad spectrum of ways to monitize some of Trump's Big Lie.  
**Fact**: The 306 electoral college votes for President Biden defeated former president Donald Trump in the 2020 election and serious investigations into the 2020 election and more than 60 court cases brought by Trumpophiles have revealed no evidence of fraud, and as outlined on this page Trump faces federal criminal charges for some of his efforts to overturn the election.  
Cat Zakrzewski [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/07/amazon-alexa-news-2020-election-misinformation/) (in the Washington Post) on October 7, 2023, that "Amazon’s Alexa has been claiming the 2020 election was stolen."  She went on to detail a number of ways that Alexa delivered this Trump lie.
>(*Alexa told testers that*) The 2020 races were “notorious for many incidents of irregularities and indications pointing to electoral fraud taking place in major metro centers”  
>Alexa contended that Trump won Pennsylvania  
Both common Trump/Trump devotee lies.  
>Alexa disseminates misinformation about the race, even as parent company Amazon promotes the tool as a reliable election news source to more than 70 million estimated users.  
>Amazon’s Alexa has proliferated across a number of devices. It’s been embedded in inexpensive home speakers, headphones, TVs and cars — a familiar helper that sets alarms, plays songs and checks the weather for millions of Americans.
>But Amazon has sought to position the voice assistant as a reliable source for information about elections for the last half decade.
>It’s unclear how long Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant has been serving up false claims in response to questions about the 2020 election.
