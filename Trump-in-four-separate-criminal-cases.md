## Some of Trump's Crimes  

DRAFT.

### Trump 47 Employing A Program of Intimidation, Coercion, and Punishment  
Why?  Thomas B. Edsall argues convincingly that it is for [revenge and positioning for self-interested corruption](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/opinion/trump-agenda-firings-chaos.html?unlocked_article_code=1.zk4.HfjO.sqm77B4RcZH0&smid=url-share)  (*[joined by Musk in using the power of government for self-interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/opinion/elon-musk-south-africa.html?unlocked_article_code=1.0U4.H0vb.JUYaiFbfH6s9&smid=url-share)*) while "[deactivating internal and external accountability and oversight mechanisms](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/opinion/trump-agenda-firings-chaos.html?unlocked_article_code=1.zk4.HfjO.sqm77B4RcZH0&smid=url-share)" and making themselves the "law in America."  


### Four Main Indictments Against Trump (34 convictions), Plus Two Civil Cases (lost both)  
See the [Trump Trials Clearinghouse](https://www.justsecurity.org/88175/trump-trials-clearinghouse/)  
1. **Washington D.C.: Federal case on obstruction in the 2020 election.** [Trump faces four federal charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/01/trump-indicted-jan-6-overturn-2020-election-results) for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. (*the trial was initially scheduled to start 2024-03-04 but the U.S. Supreme Court has slow-walked a review of Trump's claim of total immunity for 6 months - as of 26 June 2024 they have not released an opinion.*)  
2. **Florida: Federal classified-documents case.** [Trump faced 40 federal charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/27/trump-carlos-deoliveira-classified-indictment) over accusations that he kept top-secret government documents at Mar-a-Lago — his home and private club — and then intentionally resisted government demands that he return them. Judge [Aileen Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon) [slow-walked most aspects of judicial processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(classified_documents_case)) that made up this case since June 8, 2023 and before [dismissing the case on July 15, 2024 ruling that the appointment of Smith had been unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(classified_documents_case)#Dismissal_and_appeal).  
3. **Georgia: State case on obstruction in the 2020 election** [Trump faces 13 state charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/14/trump-indictment-georgia-election-2020), Prosecutors alleg that he tried to undo the election results in that state and a Georgia grand jury indicted Trump and 18 allies on August 14, 2023. (*On 5 June 2024 [the Georgia Court of Appeals stayed this case](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/us/trump-georgia-election-case-fani-willis.html) until an appellate panel resolves questions about whether the district attorney in Fulton County should be disqualified from prosecuting the case because of a conflict of interest.*)  
  * Trump co-defendant [Kenneth Chesebro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Chesebro) (62) plead guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to file false documents in the Georgia election case. He also agreed to truthfully testify in the case against others.  Chesebro was the architect of a plan to use fake Trump electors in Georgia and other key states to replace legitimate 2020 electoral college votes for Biden -- disrupting and delaying the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021 and violating the rules in the Electoral Count Act, with the goal of swinging the election to Trump. If he follows through and testifies honestly at his co-compirator's trials, this could be a material threat to Trump, Rudy Giuliani and others.  
  * [Sidney Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Powell) (68), co-defendant with Donald Trump in the Georgia election conspiracy case, plead guilty and agreed to testify in future trials. Powell played a central role in the conspiracy as an election lawyer who baselessly claimed widespread election fraud in 2020.  She was part of Trump’s inner circle of 2020 election denial leaders. She was at strategic meetings, part of important conversations, and she met in-person with Trump at the White House, including on Dec. 18, 2020, to discuss, among other topics, having the military seize voting machines in certain specific counties and "re-running" their elections. She was also involved in tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.  If she follows through and testifies honestly at her co-compirator's trials, this could be a material threat to Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and others.  
  * Trump co-defendant [Jenna Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Ellis) (38) plead guilty in Georgia election case. Ellis, hired in late 2019 as a legal adviser to the Trump campaign was later part of the post-2020 election legal team had direct links to Trump and also worked closely with Giuliani. If she follows through and testifies honestly at her co-compirator's trials, this could be a material threat to Trump, Rudy Giuliani and others.  
4. **New York: State business fraud case involving a hush money payment in the 2016 election cycle.** [May 30, 2024, Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_in_New_York), (*also see the primary source "[Verdict Form](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JustSecurityNY2016ElectionInterferenceCaseClearinghouse-Verdict-sheet-May-30-2024.pdf)" (May 30, 2024) documenting how Trump was found guilty by a jury of his peers*), [NY state charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/30/trump-ny-indictment) in connection with hush money paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign. (*indictment filed March 30, 2023*).  
  * Contrary to Trump/MAGA followers/Fox & Twitter echo chamber lies, felony prosecutions for falsifying business records are a relatively common event in New York.  See:  
    * "[New York State Has Issued Nearly 9,800 Felony Charges of Falsifying Business Records Since 2015](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/04/06/new-york-state-has-issued-nearly-9800-felony-charges-of-falsifying-business-records-since-2015/?slreturn=20240501083804)." By Emily Saul, April 06, 2023. Quote: "Data shows 9,794 cases involving state penal law 175.10, or falsifying business records in the first degree, have been arraigned in both local and superior New York state courts since 2015."  
    * "[Survey of Past New York Felony Prosecutions for Falsifying Business Records](https://www.justsecurity.org/85605/survey-of-past-new-york-felony-prosecutions-for-falsifying-business-records/)." by Siven Watt, Norman L. Eisen and Ryan Goodman, March 21, 2023.  
  * Trump continued to use lies in his attacks on the legal process, the legal system more broadly, and the lawyers and judges who populate it (*along with their families*).  "[Trump responds to guilty verdict with attacks and false claims](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-misinformation-trump-trial-f451dbf66ceebb1da12f1419e56f11ff)." By Melissa Goldin, May 31, 2024.  
  * Echoing other Trump supporters, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds (*who endorsed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in the Iowa Caucuses*) [said on June 1, 2024](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20240603&goTo=A004&artid=0&editionStart=Des%20Moines%20Register)  that: "They’ve weaponized the justice system with a political persecution of our nominee and Biden’s opponent..." "But I can tell you without hesitation that on Nov. 5 the people of this country will weigh in."  
5. **New York: State business fraud case involving years of creating/using fraudulent Trump company financial reports to manipulate loan and insurance acquisition.** [New York Attorney General Corporate Fraud Case](https://www.justsecurity.org/89120/clearinghouse-new-york-attorney-general-corporate-fraud-case/) Trump, his associates and some Trump companies were found guilty on [Feb. 22, 2024, requiring them to pay New York hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Just-Security-N.Y.-Civil-Fraud-Trump-Clearinghouse-%E2%80%94-Final-judgment-of-Justice-Engoron-Feb.-22-2024-e-filed-Feb.-23.pdf). *Trump lawyers have filed appeal(s).*  
6. **Trump found liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll.**  In May 2023, a NY jury unanimously found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer [E. Jean Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll) and awarded Carroll $5 million in damages (*a sum that a federal judge subsequently upheld as reasonable*). The term "sexually abusing" appears because of the narrow definition of "rape" in New York before September 2024, when it was redefined as "[nonconsensual vaginal, anal, and oral contact](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/30/new-york-rape-definition-expanded-bill-kathy-hochul-e-jean-carroll-donald-trump)."  In July 2023, Judge Kaplan said that the verdict found that Trump had raped Carroll according to the common definition of the word, i.e. not requiring penile penetration. In August 2023, Kaplan dismissed a Trump countersuit and wrote that Carroll's accusation of rape is "substantially true."  In Jan. 2024, a second jury awarded Carroll an additional $83.3 million in damages after finding that after losing the first trial Trump repeatedly defamed the writer in his social media posts and other public statements. (*[see the Wikipedia summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll_v._Donald_J._Trump)*).  After [George Stephanopoulos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos), refering to the E. Jean Carroll trial, said "*the former president had been found 'liable for rape' in a civil trial in New York*" Trump filed a defamation suit against ABC News and Mr. Stephanopoulos.  On 14 December 2024, ABC announced they had settled with Trump by agreeing to give $15 million to Mr. Trump’s future presidential foundation and museum, pay Trump $1 million for his legal fees, as well as issue a public apology.  In the context of long-standing *freedom of the press* norms, free speech protections and clarifications concerning E. Jean Carroll's accusations and the term "rape," the ABC settlement seems unusual -- even establishing a precedent that Trumpers can succeed at suing news organizations and individual reporters who release reporting critical of their statements or behaviors.  


Trump has responded to these indictments by increasing his use of authoritarian language and threats, as well as accellerating his campaign of dehumanizing all those he chooses as targets.  Trump and actors within his control have used increasingly hostile and threatening authoritarianism rhetoric against their perceived enemies and against laws and processes that inhibit their personal and political *freedom* in order to lay the groundwork for rejecting any person, people, organization, law, etc. that might threaten Trump and Trumpists existence as a national group and a distinct culture.  [Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/) maintains an up-to-date collection of these statements at "[American Autocracy Threat Tracker -- A Comprehensive Catalog Based on Donald Trump and His Associates’ Plans, Promises, and Propositions](https://www.justsecurity.org/92714/american-autocracy-threat-tracker/)."  

[Amy B Wang wrote a recent article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/09/13/trump-putin-election-interfence/) on the Putin statements that Trump has been highlighting:  
>“As for the prosecution of Trump, for us what is happening in today’s conditions, in my opinion, is good because it shows the rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others democracy,” Putin said at an economic forum in eastern Russia.  

During a Veterans Day speech on November 11, 2023, Trump told a crowd in Claremont, New Hampshire, that his political enemies are “like vermin” -- *the implication being that violence and murder of "vermin" is acceptable/necessary.*  [Margaret Hartmann, wrote](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/trump-vermin-hitler.html) that both Hitler and Italy’s Benito Mussolini compared their enemies to rodents during their rise to power in the 1920s and 1930s. Trump said:
>"Today, especially, in honor of our great veterans on Veterans Day, we pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical-left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country — that lie and steal and cheat on elections and will do anything possible. They’ll do anything, whether legally or illegally, to destroy America and to destroy the American Dream."  
>"The real threat is not from the racial right; the real threat is from the radical left, and it’s growing every day. Every single day. The threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous, and grave than the threat from within. Our threat is from within. Because if you have a capable, competent, smart, tough leader — Russia, China, North Korea — they’re not going to want to play with us."  

Trump followed up by [posting the same message](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111393315342651569) on his (failing) MAGA social media platform.  

In December 2023 Trump repeatedly described undocumented immigrants as "poisoning the blood of our country," which appears to act as a *dog whistle* to Replacement Theory believers **and** to White Nationalist and Neo-Nazi groups.  [Isaac Arnsdorf reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/12/16/trump-authoritarians-putin-orban-poisoning-blood/) that Trump:  
>"repeated his own inflammatory language against undocumented immigrants, by accusing them of “poisoning the blood of our country” — a phrase that immigrant groups and civil rights advocates have condemned as reminiscent as Hitler in his book “Mein Kampf,” in which he told Germans to “care for the purity of their own blood” by eliminating Jews."  

The U.S. Supreme Court decided in the Trump Colorado Ballot Case -- [Trump v. Anderson, No. 23-719](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/04/us/trump-supreme-court-colorado-ballot) -- that we cannot use the "plain language" of Section 3 of the 14th Ammendment -- which says, broadly, that insurrectionists and those who aid them cannot hold any oath-required State or Federal office -- to exclude Donald J. Trump from the U.S. Presidency unless the U.S. Congress "first pass legislation to implement how that enforcement works and under what standards" (*another new invention by this court and another instance of this court deciding issues that were not brought before them*).  It appears that the Supreme Court has also removed the right of Congress disqualify Trump under Section 3 when it meets to certify electoral college votes on the Jan. 6 after an election unless Congress first implements the new statute(s) whose requirement(s) the court invented in their decision.  

Trump's money-losing, member-losing and feature-limited chat-centric, Twitter-like social network [Truth Social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social) has been transformed into a [meme stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_stock) by the massive donation to the failed presidential candidate by [special-purpose acquisition company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-purpose_acquisition_company) (SPAC) [Digital World Acquisition Corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_World_Acquisition_Corporation) (DWAC) that resulted in a business liability ([Trump Media & Technology Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Media_%26_Technology_Group) (TMTG)) being valued on [NASDAQ as DJT](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/DJT:NASDAQ?window=1M) at more than $8B US. on 26 March 2024 (*[Trump was given ownership of 60 percent of the new Trump Media (DJT)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/26/truth-social-trump-djt-social-media-stock/), meaning $4.6B*).  That transformation was facilitated by [China-based ARC Capital](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/12/23/trump-spac-deal-sec/) with offices in [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai) and [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan), China (*odd, given Trump's enthusiastic criticisms of China and Wuhan*). Who else is making money on Trump's 36-employee cash-burning social network platform? -- see the analysis in "[Truth Social lost $58 million last year. Here’s who made money anyway](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/trump-media-truth-social-payout/)."  

* In the classified documents case that Smith has also brought against the former president in June, the Trump team slow-walked the schedule of the proceedings, and Federal Judge Aileen M. Cannon enabled their strategy before finally just ending it by declaring the Special Procecuter "illegal."

##### Businesses have found a broad spectrum of ways to monitize some of Trump's Big Lie.  
**Fact**: The 306 electoral college votes for President Biden defeated former president Donald Trump in the 2020 election and serious investigations into the 2020 election and more than 60 court cases brought by Trumpophiles have revealed no evidence of material fraud, and as outlined on this page Trump faces federal criminal charges for some of his efforts to overturn the election.  
Cat Zakrzewski [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/07/amazon-alexa-news-2020-election-misinformation/) (in the Washington Post) on October 7, 2023, that "Amazon’s Alexa has been claiming the 2020 election was stolen."  She went on to detail a number of ways that Alexa delivered this Trump lie.  
>(*Alexa told testers that*) The 2020 races were “notorious for many incidents of irregularities and indications pointing to electoral fraud taking place in major metro centers”  
>Alexa contended that Trump won Pennsylvania  

Both are common Trump/Trump devotee lies.  

>Alexa disseminates misinformation about the race, even as parent company Amazon promotes the tool as a reliable election news source to more than 70 million estimated users.  
>Amazon’s Alexa has proliferated across a number of devices. It’s been embedded in inexpensive home speakers, headphones, TVs and cars — a familiar helper that sets alarms, plays songs and checks the weather for millions of Americans.  
>But Amazon has sought to position the voice assistant as a reliable source for information about elections for the last half decade.  
>It’s unclear how long Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant has been serving up false claims in response to questions about the 2020 election.

#### Tens of Thousands of Psychiatrists and Psychologists Warned of Trump's Unfitness for Office  
Donald Trump in Psychology Today:  
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/president-donald-trump  
>"Psychologists and commentators from all ideological camps early converged on a label of narcissistic personality disorder as the condition that “explains” Trump’s behavior."  
>"...more than 70,000 mental health professionals who signed a petition warning of Trump's potential dangerousness, despite longstanding professional injunctions against "diagnosing" public figures whom experts have not personally examined."
