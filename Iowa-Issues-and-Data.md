# Iowa Issues and Data  
*This is an early draft of topics of concern.*  

By many measures over the last decade Iowa's Governors and legislature succeeded in weakening Iowa's education, manufacturing base, environment, civil rights, elections, health and municipal infrastructure and operations.  Sure, some can cite isolated statistics that imply *goodness*, but overall, Iowans seem poorer, sicker and have fewer opportunities for social & economic success.  

## Internet Connectivity  
I read wildly varying characterizations of Internet connectivity across the state of Iowa.  Because Internet connectivity is an important input to the success of education, business, and governing (democracy) of the state, it is critical that we have an unambiguous, trustworthy, shared understanding of its current state.  
'Ookla for Good' maintains an open data set that includes data on *Intetnet speeds* and *coverage* across the United States, including Iowa for both mobile and fixed Internet connections.  They gather their data via their *speedtest* application. Using this link: [https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good/open-data](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good/open-data) narrow the scope to "Iowa, United States" and choose a data set.  When comparing Q3 2023 (similar to Q4 2021) fixed and mobile Internet coverage data for Iowa against Missouri, Wisconsin or Illinois (*or a number of other states*), too much of Iowa that is outside urban areas still looks like a digital wasteland. 	
  * Not only is connectivity **coverage** limited in Iowa, **upload/download speeds** are limited as well.  In Q3 2023 Iowa was 36th for mobile and 44th for fixed connection download speeds (*mobile speeds being far, far below measured speeds in Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri, and fixed speeds falling even below Nebraska, South Dakota, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Maine*). In Q4 2023 Iowa dropped to 37th for median download speeds (in Q4 2021 Iowa was also 44th, *8th from the slowest*, in the nation with median download speed of 38.81 Mbps and median upload 7.72 Mbps).   [https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states#market-analysis](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states#market-analysis).  This connectivity sloth is in spite of Iowa Governor Reynolds saying for years that Internet access is a priority for her administration...  
  * Why use Ookla?  Given their descriptions of their data, it seems like a useful source for Internet connectivity data.  "Every day, over ten million unique tests are actively initiated by our users in the locations and at the times when their connectivity matters to them. Since our founding in 2006, an unparalleled total of more than 40 billion tests have been taken with Speedtest." [https://www.speedtest.net/about](https://www.speedtest.net/about) and "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide use Speedtest® to measure their internet connection. With over 18 million consumer-initiated tests taken daily and billions of data points gathered, Ookla® data paints a clear picture of the performance, quality, and availability of virtually every network in the world." [https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good)  
  * Raw data: "Speedtest by Ookla Global Fixed and Mobile Network Performance Maps." "Global fixed broadband and mobile (cellular) network performance, allocated to zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator). Data is provided in both Shapefile format as well as Apache Parquet with geometries represented in Well Known Text (WKT) projected in EPSG:4326. Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy."  Updated quarterly.

### Elections  
A non-scientific review of Iowa legislator's recently filed legislation tagged as about "elections" shows that the following topics (*in no particular order*) were topics that legislators were attempting to change: ```boards, commissions, and councils, elections and politics, government entities, voting, absentee voting, ballots, canvasses of votes, canvassing for votes, proxy voting, runoff elections, voter registration, voting systems examiners board, voting and write-in voting```.  

* Iowa legislators showed **a lot** of interest in mucking with elections in 2021-2022 sessions.  A [search of their "Legislative Documents" site](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/publications/search?tab=true&rows=10&start=0&sort=score%20desc&q=elections&fq=-status%3A%22Reserved%22%20AND%20-status%3A%22Repealed%22%20AND%20-status%3A%22Rescinded%22&fq=(l1%3A%22leg%3A0978%7C89th%20GA%202nd%20Session%22%20OR%20l1%3A%22leg%3A0979%7C89th%20GA%201st%20Session%22)) shows **855** individual pieces of legislation filed in one status or another (*many of those did not pass in the 2021-2022 sessions*). For example, here are three at *random*:  
	* [SJR9](https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SJR9/2021):	A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to the qualifications of electors. (Formerly SSB 1083.)	2022-06-21. Proof of publication certified. S.J. 943.  
	* [SF413](https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SF413/2021):	A bill for an act relating to the conduct of elections, including absentee ballots and voter list maintenance activities, making penalties applicable, and including effective date and applicability provisions. (Formerly SSB 1199.)  
	* [SF568](https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SF568/2021):	A bill for an act relating to the conduct of elections, including nominations, procedures for proposed amendments to the Iowa Constitution, and absentee voting, and including effective date provisions. (Formerly SSB 1237.)  
* Iowa legislators again showed **a lot** of interest in mucking with elections in 2023.  A [search of their "Legislative Documents" site](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/publications/search?tab=true&rows=10&start=0&sort=score%20desc&q=elections&fq=-status%3A%22Reserved%22%20AND%20-status%3A%22Repealed%22%20AND%20-status%3A%22Rescinded%22&fq=(l1%3A%22leg%3A0976%7C90th%20GA%202nd%20Session%22%20OR%20l1%3A%22leg%3A0977%7C90th%20GA%201st%20Session%22)) shows **644** individual pieces of legislation filed in one status or another (*I assume this number is a partial *overcount* & includes some level of duplication based on limitations in the search feature, and note that many of those did not pass in 2023*).
* In 2024 Iowa legislators again showed **a lot** of interest in mucking with elections.  A crude [search of their "Legislative Documents" site](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/publications/search#advanced) shows **586** individual pieces of legislation filed in one status or another (*310 "elections" + 182 "voting" + 29 "voter registration" + 65 "ballots" -- I assume this number is a partial *overcount* & includes some level of duplication based on limitations in the search feature, and note that many of those did not pass in 2024*).  
* Two weeks before the 2024 election, Iowa Secretary of State [Paul Pate released](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=08524e977_134d50a) a very low quality (*lots of known weaknesses at time of issue*) list of Iowa Residents that he suspected of voter crimes -- primarily of voting while being a non-citizen.  As county personnel were approaching maximum workload for the pending election, Pate required counties to act on his flawed list. This appeared to be little more than a public show of support to a Trumpist narrative of *massive illegal non-citizen voting*, as well as a tactic to add chaos into election activities, to sow doubt about the *integrity* of elections, to instill fear in legal voter populations who are also immigrants, and possibly to support the Trumpist narrative that voting is *bad* in the U.S. and should be replaced with something else.  County personnel identified lots of errors in Pate's list...  Pate's sloppy (*hostile?*) "research" to construct his list of 2000 voters who's citizenship must be challenged was quickly proven when, as [Brianne Pfannenstiel reported](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=08524e977_134d50a) in the Des Moines Register that "As part of the lawsuit from LULAC, the state filed a brief that said on Oct. 24, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agent contacted the secretary of state’s office and agreed to look up each of the 2,176 people on the list and confirm their citizenship. After reviewing the list, the agent told Pate’s office that 12% of the people were not citizens."  [Stephen Gruber-Miller reported](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=1e838aa14_134fa0f) in the Des Moines Register that in March 2025 "Pate said an audit of the state’s voter registration list confirmed 277 noncitizens on Iowa’s voter rolls, including 35 noncitizens who successfully voted in the 2024 election and five more who tried to vote but had their ballots rejected."  
The hype surrounding Republican "theories" about non-citizen voting along with a couple very close elections resulted in the passage of [House File 928](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=HF928), overhauling Iowa’s election recount procedures and [House File 954](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=HF954), also bans ranked-choice voting in Iowa and makes it harder for third-party groups such as Libertarians to qualify as major political parties -- both signed into law by Gov. Reynolds on June 2, 2025.  [Gruber-Miller reported](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=1e838aa14_134fa0f) that Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, "praised lawmakers and Reynolds for enacting the legislation, saying the laws 'add additional layers of integrity to our robust election procedures.'"  This new legislation makes it legal for election workers to ask voters about their citizenship status at the polls -- expect this new tool to be used for targeted racial profiling, discrimination and voter intimidation (*who needs [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States) when you can just drive away opposition voters from the polling places?*)...  


### Water in Iowa  
* A [2019 University of Iowa study](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20221020&goTo=A007&artid=1) found Iowa leads the country in manure waste. A [2025 study, “Currents of Change,” also found that this "nitrate problem is uniquely Iowan"](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/06/25/polk-county-water-report-pins-unhealthy-rivers-on-ag-pollution/). (*In January 2025, Donnelle Eller wrote [in the Des Moines Register](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=1fb42590c_134f82c) that "Iowa [is] the nation’s top producers of corn, pork, eggs and ethanol, second-largest soybean grower and seventh-largest beef and turkey producer."*)  
* [751 rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs and wetlands are considered impaired](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20221020&goTo=A007&artid=1) -- roughly half of Iowa’s waterways that were assessed.  
* In June 2025 Donnelle Eller [wrote in the Des Moines Register that](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=2f6705ce0_134fa1e):  
>Central Iowa Water Works says its first- ever ban on lawn watering is cutting demand and easing worries that its utilities — hampered by high levels of health-endangering nitrates in the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers — will be able to meet residents’ and businesses’ essential water needs and allow them to avoid more drastic measures.  Still, residents should prepare to continue the mandatory conservation measure for “weeks, not days,” given continued high nitrate levels, Des Moines Water Works General Manager Ted Corrigan said in a news conference Tuesday, June 17.  
>...nitrates in the Raccoon River had reached just over 20 milligrams per liter, twice the level considered safe for infants under 6 months and pregnant women to consume. It was the highest nitrate level recorded since 2013, when they hit a record 24.39 milligrams per liter.  
>nitrates remain around 15 milligrams per liter in both the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, ...about 33% above the federal safe drinking water standard and extensive treatment is necessary to render the water acceptable for consumption.  
>the existing Des Moines Water Works nitrate removal plant...operates separately from the usual water processing system. Costly to operate, the equipment has been in continuous use for more than 55 days. The water authority is investing $344 million in the (*nitrate removal*) expansion...  
>West Des Moines Water Works data shows the city’s growing Microsoft data centers were the utility’s largest water users for the 12 months ending in March, at 70.5 million gallons.  But Murphy said data centers’ average use is about 2% to 7% of the water pumped by the utility — far less than the share that was going to lawn watering.  
* Chris Jones, author of “[The Swine Republic: Struggles with the Truth about Agriculture and Water Quality](https://www.amazon.com/Swine-Republic-Struggles-Agriculture-Quality/dp/1948509407/ref=sr_1_1),” and on SubStack at [@riverraccoon](https://substack.com/@riverraccoon) [described](https://enewspaper.desmoinesregister.com?publink=2deb6be1e_1351f29) the lawn watering ban in this way: 
>“I think the reason was (that we were) essentially rationing water,” [was that] “We had what we call pollution-induced scarcity, and they could not treat enough water adequately, so the utility required a reduction in use.”  
* In November 2024 the EPA was trying to get the Iowa DNR to add several rivers used as major sources of drinking water to their list of Impared waterways. Donnelle Eller [wrote in the Des Moines Register that](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=2876615d5_134d4ff):  
>States are required to evaluate their rivers, lakes, streams and reservoirs every two years to determine if they meet standards for drinking water, recreation, fishing and other uses. Then states are asked to put together water quality improvement plans. In 2022, Iowa had 597 impaired water segments.  
>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources should add seven segments of the Cedar, Des Moines, Iowa, Raccoon and South Skunk rivers due to high levels of nitrate, a form of nitrogen that can be released into water from manure and commercial fertilizers.  
>(The Iowaa DNR) submitted its list to the EPA in June, identifying 577 water segments with 746 impairments caused by a range of pollutants, including bacteria, animal waste and fertilizer spills.  The EPA said water samples taken from the seven segments it wants added exceeded federal nitrate limits 40 times, primarily from 2020 to 2022. The Cedar River segment flows into Cedar Rapids, the Raccoon River into Des Moines, the Des Moines River into Des Moines and Ottumwa, and the Iowa River into Iowa City.  
>Along with 12 other state and national groups, Food & Water Watch has asked the EPA to prohibit new or expanded livestock operations in northeast Iowa and investigate land-use practices that could cause contamination, among other actions (northeast Iowa’s karst region is characterized by a porous limestone geology which increases the risk of contaminants making their way into groundwater and aquifers that serve as drinking water for large populations).  “Big Ag is polluting our waterways with impunity — and we are paying for it with our health,” Michaelyn Mankel, an organizer for the group, said in a statement. “EPA must take emergency action to intervene in Iowa’s worsening nitrate contamination crisis.”  
In July 2025, [Donnelle Eller again reminded Iowans](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=054f54a91_134fa7a) (or [here](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2025/07/10/iowans-grapple-with-solutions-to-water-nitrate-problems-lawn-watering-ban/84276358007/) that:  
">Even combined with federal investments, however, the state’s spending falls short of the funding needed to meet the state’s nutrient reduction goals. For example, it would take $756 million annually over five decades to cover 60% of Iowa farm acres with cover crops, build wetlands to treat 27% of agriculture land and bioreactors — woodchip-filled trenches that convert nitrates in farmland drainage to nitrogen gas — on 60% of drained land, the Nutrient Reduction Strategy said."  
>"Using Iowa Department of Agriculture data, Jones said farmers bought about 2.54 billion pounds of nitrogen products last year to fertilize 12.9 million acres of corn — or 197 pounds per acre. It alone was 38 pounds per acre more nitrogen than the 159 pounds per acre than last year’s crop needed, based on Iowa State University’s recommendations for the optimal amount. Iowa farmers also added 1.35 billion pounds of nitrogen-rich manure from Iowa’s pigs, cattle, chickens and turkeys, Jones said. And “that pencils out to 105 pounds per corn acre,” pushing the total nitrogen to 302 pounds per corn acre, he said. “It ends up somewhere, and that somewhere can be streams and aquifers.”"  
Gov. Kim Reynolds [responded to summer 2025 water quality protesters saying](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=2c0b6479a_134fa7b):  
>"But mark my word: They’re (*Iowa Farmers*) working every single day to implement conservation practices, because they know it benefits everybody."  
* The [Iowa Department of Natural Resources](https://www.iowadnr.gov/) (DNR) 2025-01-31 [Cami Koons wrote in the Iowa Capital Dispatch](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/briefs/water-advocates-challenge-dnr-final-decision-on-permit-for-cattle-facility-near-bloody-run-creek/) about DNR's final decision on Permit no. 10172-R1 to Supreme Beef for a 10,000-head confined-animal feeding operation (*cattle*) near [Bloody Run Creek](https://www.iowadnr.gov/Fishing/Where-to-Fish/Trout-Streams/Stream-Details?lakeCode=TBR22) and the porous bedrock of [the “driftless” region](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCeGFF8x83dnxz6nMLTQ58IWwEoPs1LknoxeLyYWgBDZAfzDbm0Eh72hy8E8KgvjmtB6fh85nM40ISu6BZhYqDf64T6jBZ824D6CpPiBf0f-P6qkJPq0jaTXSxDRbNbPWeXlShV5S5up_KPH4fzAt3BwTALJ9BVkrniTwJsj23-DGqa4tzAPuFpWo2FA/s751/4E5A04AE-688A-4538-911F-C16059FC5DBD.jpeg) of [northeast Iowa](https://www.iowadnr.gov/Portals/idnr/uploads/water/wells/IGWS%20Karst%20Map.pdf). The permit grants "Supreme Beef Llc (Jared Walz)" to extract "21.90 Million Gallons Per Year (MGY)  @ 100.00 GPM" (*Supreme Beef reported extracting more than 19 MGY in each of 2022, 2023 & 2024*) from the Jordan aquifer (*to access the permit, search for 10172 at the DNR [Water Allocation Compliance and Online Permitting (WACOP) search page](https://programs.iowadnr.gov/wacop/Home/PermitSearch)*). Much of that water ends up in an excrement slurry that is used on farmland (*where rain can wash some portion of it into waterways which can result in the kinds of imparements described above and into ground water/aquifers that feed drinking water wells*), which is not good for anyone. Chris Jones, a chemist and research engineer at the University of Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research (IIHR), and the head of the Iowa Water Quality Information System since 2015, [installed a sensing station in Bloody Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Run_(Iowa)) to monitor its water quality and then published what he learned.  [Wikipedia reports that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Run_(Iowa)#Pollution) Jones was repeatedly threatened by Republican politicians, particularly [Dan Zumbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Zumbach) (*who was the father-in-law of the co-owner of Supreme Beef*), for his research, and left the University of Iowa on May 16, 2023. Nobody "*wins*" in scenarios like this -- and Iowans, Iowa ecosystems, Iowa waterways, Iowa drinking water, and those downstream suffer.  Iowa Legislature voted on defunding the water quality sensor network, attempting to blind Iowan's view into the levels of poison delivered into Iowa's waterways and aiming to eliminate opportunities to identify water quality trends...  As I write this sentence on 01 Jan 2026, USGS "[Sensor ID : 05482500](https://iwqis.iowawis.org/app/?iwqis=/sensors-map/05482500)" (on the North Raccoon River near Jefferson, IA) upstream from my drinking water utility's water source reports that "Nitrate + Nitrite as N: 17.1 mg/L" -- almost twice the drinking water threshold.  


### Lead Poisoning  
The CDC says there is no safe level for lead in blood. Exposure at any level has been shown to cause irreversible harm to children, including damage to the brain and nervous systems, slowed growth and development, learning and behavior problems, and hearing and speech difficulty.  

Nearly 70% of homes in Iowa were built before 1978, when the toxic lead paint was banned for residential use, a proportion far larger than in most other states. Children in low-income families and children of color are most at risk for lead exposure, according to several studies.  

A 2021 study by Quest Diagnostics and Boston Children’s Hospital found that nearly 2% of U.S. children had lead in their blood at or above the 5-microgram action level. It found that in Iowa, the figure was much higher: 3.6%, the ninth-largest proportion among U.S. states.  

Iowa has the nation’s fourth-highest percentage of children under 6 who have detectable levels of lead in their blood — 76%, according to a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics in September 2021 that looked at blood tests from 1.14 million children under 6.  

At the same time, he said, enforcement “is weakening or absent in most parts of the state.”

### Housing  
(September 2022) Polk County is seeing a rise in the number of people who are homeless. According to a point-in-time count conducted by Homeward, the county’s homelessness planning organization, the population increased by 23% in the last year. And the number of people who are unsheltered in Polk County has nearly doubled since January.

### Food/Hunger  
Food insecurity in Iowa by the numbers (*By F. Amanda Tugade, 01-12-2024, [The Des Moines Register](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=0114326e8_134d555)*)  
● The average cost of a meal in Iowa is $4.  
● More than 344,000 Iowans are food insecure. More than 30% — roughly 110,000 — are children.  
● 1 in 9 adults — and 1 in 6 children — do not have enough to eat or know where their next meal is coming from.  
  * Working is not the core issue.  Gov. Reynolds organized a task force that [found](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=051a3bdd8_134f960):  
>"Iowa is a national leader in the share of households with all parents working but has too few options for child care: 23 percent of Iowans — and nearly 35 percent of rural Iowans — live in a “child care desert,” the Governor’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board reported."  
● Families with children spend an average of $331 a week on groceries or 41% more than families without kids.  
● The average amount of extra money Iowans experiencing food insecurity need to cover food costs is roughly $245 million.  
● To qualify for any food assistance (*in Iowa*), a single person’s gross monthly limit is $1,632 (*$19,584/yr*), according to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services.  
  ● The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) [reported December 12, 2024](https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/real-personal-consumption-expenditures-state-and-real-personal-income-state-and) that Iowan's [Real Personal Income](https://www.bea.gov/resources/methodologies/rpp) fell 2.0% in 2023 - the worst showing compared to all the other 49 states. That should be read in the context of (at the time) Iowa being ranked "[among top 10 states with highest tax rates](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=0c3e87246_134f8ea).  
● Even as table-food farmers across Iowa are already invested in the 2025 season, on 10 March 2025 Don McDowell, the Iowa Department of Agriculture’s spokesman, said "[it should not come as a surprise](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=0cd6474f2_134f8ec)" Iowa Department of Agriculture notified participants in two federal programs that buys local food for thousands of children across Iowa would lose $11.3 million in funding for 2025 through 2028. I assume from the context of McDowell's comments that he meant that Iowa's children and table-food farmers and their communities are not nearly as important as scoring short term *points* against perceived political enemies.  The cuts eliminated programs that provided locally grown food to "[135 Iowa school districts, 300 farmers and 951 locations such as pantries, churches and early care sites in 98 counties that distribute local food, according to the Iowa Valley Resource Conservation and Development, a nonprofit that works with farmers, schools and other local food groups.](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=0cd6474f2_134f8ec)" in Iowa.  
 * The high cost of food hits lower income / lower wealth people most:  See: [Food at home in U.S. city average, all urban consumers, seasonally adjusted](https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CUSR0000SAF11) and [Food spending and share of after-tax income spent on food across U.S. households](https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/Charts/58371/food-prices_fig10.png?v=96744)  


### Health Care  
There are MANY indicators of health.  Just one is the level of cancers experienced by given populations.  The [Iowa Cancer Registry](https://shri.public-health.uiowa.edu/) and the [National Cancer Institute](https://seer.cancer.gov/), part of the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/) report that Iowa’s cancer rate second highest in the U.S. and rising.  That is not good for any Iowans and seems to indicate that we have some serious health concerns in the state.  Iowa Cancer Registry's "[2025 Cancer in Iowa](https://shri.public-health.uiowa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cancer-in-iowa-2025.pdf)" report starts with:  
>"Iowa continues to have the second highest age-adjusted rate of new cancers diagnosed and is one of only two states with a rising age-adjusted rate of new cancers."  
>"An estimated 21,200 new, invasive cancers will be diagnosed among Iowans in 2025."  
>"An estimated 6,300 Iowans will die from cancer in 2025."  
>"The number of cancer survivors is growing, with an estimated 171,535 survivors currently living in Iowa."  
See the "[Incidence rates for Iowa by County](https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/map/map.withimage.php?19&county&001&001&00&0&01&0&1&5&0#results)" (*cases per 100,000 population per year*) to get a very rough idea of cancer risk is distributed across the state.  And [the supporting data](https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/quick-profiles/index.php?tabSelected=2&statename=iowa) that breaks it down by cancer type/site.  

In 2025 state legislators passed Senate File 615, would require *able-bodied adults* on the state’s Medicaid expansion program -- the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan -- the state’s Medicaid expansion program -- to work 80 hours per month to receive benefits (*in language demonize poverty*). [Stephen Gruber-Miller wrote](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=113ba826f_134f8fb) in the Des Moines Register that SF615 contained the seeds of a plan to shrink Medicaid in Iowa:  
>"If the federal government grants a waiver for Iowa to implement work requirements for Medicaid recipients and later rescinds the waiver, the bill requires the state to end the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, subject to federal approval.  If that happens, the 181,000 Iowans enrolled in the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan would lose their health care coverage." ...roughly 700,000 Iowans are participating in the state’s Medicaid program.  
The Iowa House lawmakers generated an analogous but different bill, House File 948 which, if passed, will require *syncing* with SF615 before they could send something to Iowa's Gov. for signing.  
As a result, and in the context of [Trump 47's OBBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Big_Beautiful_Bill_Act), [Brianne Pfannenstiel, Stephen Gruber- Miller and Marissa Payne wrote in July 2025](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=204fb7fbd_134fa7e):  
>"In Iowa, Democrats on the House Joint Economic Committee estimate that 113,979 people could lose health care coverage. That includes coverage through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act."  And "According to a KFF analysis, Iowa will see an estimated $ 4.45 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over the next decade as a result of the law. Iowa Hospital Association President and CEO Chris Mitchell said even a conservative estimate of the loss of funding, which he pegs at $3.5 billion, would have a “profound” negative effect on Iowa hospitals, “particularly ones in rural areas.”"  
The $50 billion stabilization fund for all rural hospitals across the United States included in [Trump 47's OBBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Big_Beautiful_Bill_Act) to offset some of those negative effects will likely not materially reduce the negative impacts for rural hospitals throughout Iowa -- nor for the people (*poor or not*) that they currently serve.  
Iowa [already](https://hhs.iowa.gov/media/9203/download?inline#page=11) has [the fewest OB-GYN providers per capita of any state in the country](https://iowaabortionaccessfund.org/2025/01/17/iowa-is-a-maternity-care-desert/) and "[more than half of rural Iowa hospitals no longer deliver babies](https://www.iowapublicradio.org/health/2024-02-23/report-finds-more-than-half-of-rural-iowa-hospitals-no-longer-deliver-babies)."  While Gov. Reynolds uses her "[More Options for Maternal Support (MOMS) Program](https://hhs.iowa.gov/contacts/more-options-maternal-support-moms-program)," which *[may](https://hhs.iowa.gov/contacts/more-options-maternal-support-moms-program)* help select organizations providing some level of adoption counseling, or possibly parenting classes, diapers and other items for pregnant women and new mothers, as a tool to distract any questions about maternal health in Iowa.  

In November 2024 [Michaela Ramm reported for the Des Moines Register](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=0e0ca3598_134d504) that:  
>"Forty-one hospitals — or about a third of Iowa’s hospitals — have shut down their labor and delivery units from 2000 to 2021, according to a state report. In many cases, these closures left a county without a birthing facility."  
In December 2024 [Clark Kauffman reported in the Iowa Capital Dispatch](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/12/04/ombudsmen-and-advocates-join-fight-over-nursing-home-staffing-levels/) that Iowa’s Brenna Bird and Kim Reynolds were attempting to block implementation of new nursing home staffing requirements even though:  
>According to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 14% of Iowa’s 422 nursing facilities were cited for insufficient staffing in fiscal year 2023, before the new (*Biden administration*) requirements were enacted. That’s more than double the national average, which was 5.9%.  Only five other states – Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico and Oregon – had a worse record of compliance with the staffing requirements in place at that time.  
In January 2025, [Michaela Ramm and Sabine Martin reported in the Des Moines Register](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=017887b3d_134f833) that: 
>"The physician shortage in Iowa is among the worst in the country, with the state ranking 44th in the nation for its ratio of physicians to residents. According to AAMA data, Iowa had 233 physicians per 100,000 residents in 2023."  
>"Iowa also has some of the lowest rates of physician retention nationwide, according to a 2024 AAMA report. In 2023, it’s estimated Iowa retained just 22% of its medical school graduates and 36.5% of its residency graduates." (and)..." Iowa has some of the fewest residency slots in the nation."  
>"Two-thirds of Iowa’s 99 counties — home to more than 710,000 residents — are designated by the federal government as lacking enough primary care physicians."  

Echoing Trump's HHS pick, long time anti-vaccine activist ("*[“there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective”](https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-things-to-know-explained-who-is-hhs-5288a4a7277d1a0b4a7ede8f57a971ce)*") [Robert Kennedy Jr.](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/22/rfk-hhs-first-week-vaccine-advisers-workforce-00205596), in February/March of 2025 Iowa legislators appear to be rejecting the health benefits wrought by mRNA vaccines while also attempting to make Iowa less attractive to all front line health care providers by making it illegal to "[provide or administer a gene-based vaccine to another person in this state](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=sf360)." [Senate File 360](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=sf360) states that whenever a medical professional administers an mRNA vaccine in Iowa, Legislators want that individual to be charged with a [simple misdemeanor subject to a fine of five hundred dollars per incident](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=sf360)."  In addition, legislators want to ensure maximum threat to individual medical provessionals by requiring that "[the appropriate licensing board within the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing shall review the license of a person licensed under chapter 147 who violates this section](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=sf360)."  
And this anti-vaccine radicalism seems to be working as [Stephen Gruber-Miller reported](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=1511965dd_134f9a9): 4.4% of school children were not fully vaccinated in 2020, and that rate rose 7.1% unvaccinated in 2024.  But that wasn't enough for Iowa Republicans.  In [late April, 2025](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=1511965dd_134f9a9), they followed up by passing [House File 299]() that requires:  
>"K-12 schools, including public, nonpublic and charter schools, as well as child care centers, child care facilities, child development homes, community colleges, public universities and any private colleges that receive dollars through the Iowa Tuition Grant to share information about vaccine exemptions in any communications with families about vaccinations."  
*Because too many parents in Iowa are having their children vaccinated?*  

Looking back at what appears to be health care mismanagement (*i.e., governing toward goals that seem to diverge from enhancing Iowan's health*), Governor Reynolds and the Iowa "[Legislature replaced a federally funded family planning program in 2017 with a state-run one that excluded Planned Parenthood, an abortion provider, but served fewer Iowans](https://enewspaper.desmoinesregister.com?publink=03dfcebb5_134fc0a)".  Iowa Department of Public Health [reporting](https://enewspaper.desmoinesregister.com?publink=03dfcebb5_134fc0a) showed an "increase in Iowa abortions in 2018 and 2019" rather than the reduction predicted by the Reynolds' office.

### Child Care  
In February 2025, [Kevin Baskins (for the Des Moines Register) reported](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=16f59f917_134f880) that: 
>"Working Iowans with children spend an average of about 15% of their income before taxes on child care at licensed centers, more than double the 7% national average, according to Iowa Childcare Resource and Referral. And availability is limited amid a statewide labor shortage, particularly in rural areas."  


### Banning Books  
In May 2023, Gov. [Kim Reynolds signed the ambiguous and fuzzy Senate File 496](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=SF%20496&ga=90), that bans books (except "*religious books*") depicting sex acts from public schools -- threatening teachers and administrators with harsh penalties for non-compliance with their vague demands -- and resulting in the removal of more than 1,300 books from Iowa public schools.  After a 5 month delay, the Iowa State Board of Education published an equally-vague "Notice of Intended Action" -- under the heading of "Eliminating Achievement and Opportunity Gaps" -- of [changes to Iowa School rules for “General Accreditation Standards”](https://educate.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023-11-15SBE-Rules-Chapter12.pdf) in November 2023.  
See the fruits of Iowa's book banning elected officials in the database "[Library books removed in Iowa school districts](https://databases.desmoinesregister.com/database-books-removed-from-libraries-in-iowa-school-districts/)." by Tim Webber, Samantha Hernandez and [The Des Moines Register](https://www.desmoinesregister.com).  As of 2024-03-17, The Des Moines Register database includes roughly 1,820 instances of banned "[books — 615 of which are unique titles — removed from schools since the law went into effect July 1 (2023)](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/03/17/iowa-poll-half-say-new-book-ban-law-for-public-schools-goes-too-far-senate-file-496-lgbtq/72775250007/)."  
Gov. Reynolds added insult to Iowans on [June 11, 2025 when she vetoed](https://governor.iowa.gov/media/455/download?inline=&utm_medium=concernedIowan&utm_source=govdelivery) [House File 639](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF639&ga=91) *because it was too imprecise*:  
>“...good policy should draw clear, careful lines. This bill doesn’t. It combines valid concerns with vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets.”  
Yea, Gov. Reynolds holds that principle of legislative precision so dear...  :(  


### Iowa Legislature's/Governor's "Don't say gay" Law & Follow-on Hostility  
In May 2023, Gov. [Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 496](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=SF%20496&ga=90), that prohibits "[instruction related to gender identity and sexual orientation](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/SJNL/1375335.pdf#page=4)"  
in Iowa schools (*also see additional references on pages 1, 2, 3, 7, 11 and 13*). If any student "[requests an accommodation that is intended to affirm the student's gender identity](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGE/90/attachments/SF496_GovLetter.pdf#page=11)," their teacher (*or any "licensed practitioner employed by the school district"*) "[shall report the student's request to an administrator employed by the school district, and the administrator shall report the student's request to the student's parent or guardian.](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGE/90/attachments/SF496_GovLetter.pdf#page=11)"  The Governor's action also removed all mentions of "HPV," the availability of a "vaccine to prevent HPV," and references to "acquired immune deficiency syndrome" from the content required by "[health education](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGE/90/attachments/SF496_GovLetter.pdf#page=6)" and by "instruction in human growth and development](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGE/90/attachments/SF496_GovLetter.pdf#page=8)"  After a 5 month delay, the Iowa State Board of Education published a "Notice of Intended Action" -- under the heading of "Eliminating Achievement and Opportunity Gaps" -- of [changes to Iowa School rules for “General Accreditation Standards”](https://educate.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023-11-15SBE-Rules-Chapter12.pdf) in November 2023.  

In 2007, [the Iowa Legislature added protections for gender identity to the Iowa Civil Rights Act](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=0d56ec661_134f892). In January 2025 the "Proposed Committee On Judiciary Bill By Chairperson Holt" introduced [HSB 242](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=HSB242), later in February [HF 583](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=hf583) and finally [SF 418](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=SF418), that would edit Iowa civil rights law to explicitly permit descrimination based on gender identity and it describes helping facilitate that mission by requiring Iowa birth certificates only "a designation of sex of the person at birth" and repeals the right to a new certificate if "by reason of surgery or other treatment the person’s sex designation has changed" (see [pages 3-4](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/perma/0224202513856) --> one might think of this transparent effort to dehumanize a group of Iowans as the "Iowa Gender Identity Erasure Act."  Who will Iowa's Legislators choose dehumanize next?). Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed this *tumor* into law on 28 February 2025 -- making "[Iowa the first state in the nation to take away rights from a group it had previously protected](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=1cd6474f2_134f8ec) and removing any hint of living out *liberty and justice for all* from Iowa."  
>"For purposes of Code chapter 216, the bill removes gender identity as a protected class. The bill also removes gender identity as a protected class in the prohibition of discrimination under federal, state, and local law for charter schools and innovation schools." [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/perma/0225202513893](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/perma/0225202513893)  

No longer would Code chapter 216 of the Iowa Civil Rights Act protect against "[discrimination in employment, wages, public accommodations, housing, education, and credit practices based upon certain characteristics of a person](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/perma/0225202513893)" if that discrimination was based on gender identity.  
It, for example, specifically removes "gender identity" (*later, it appears, adding "experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role" in the definitions as well*) from protections against a "Creditor to refuse to offer credit life or health and accident insurance," "[a] person authorized or licensed to do business in this state to refuse to loan or extend credit or to impose terms or conditions more onerous [*based on gender identity*]," and "[a] creditor to refuse to enter into a consumer credit transaction or impose finance charges or other terms or conditions more onerous [*based on gender identity*]." It removes a mandate that charter schools or innovation zone schools "meet all applicable federal, state, and local health and safety requirements and laws prohibiting discrimination" [*on the basis of gender identity*].  

Iowa Republican legislators kept at it and Gov. Reynolds followed up on 11 June 2025 by explicitly prohibiting any form of reimbursement for surgery, procedures or therapy associated with "an individual’s gender dysphoria diagnosis."  See "[NEW SECTION . 249A.14 Sex reassignment surgeries or associated procedures —— reimbursement prohibited.](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/perma/0707202515153)" on page 14 of [H.F. 1049](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/perma/0707202515153).  

In April 2025, [Phillip Sitter wrote in the Des Moines Register](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=2abac64e8_134f95b) (*or [here](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/johnston/2025/04/22/iowa-civil-rights-law-johnston-protections-for-trans-students/83200939007/)*):  
>Republican Iowa lawmakers said the move will help other recent legislation they passed survive court challenges, including a ban on transgender youth from receiving gender-affirming medical care, restricting transgender students from using school bathrooms that align with their gender identity and banning transgender women and girls from competing in female sports.  

At a minimum, this seems like an attempt to "disappear" an already vulnerable minority in Iowa. But some components of this legislation seem to go further and suggest an attempt to punish (*or simple inflict violence upon*) an already vulnerable minority in Iowa.  

Iowa Republicans specifically highlight "the important government objectives of protecting the health, safety, and privacy of the persons in"...[Iowa] "prisons or other detention facilities..."  But then they require that trans women must be housed in Iowa men's prisons, where they will be at maximum risk of violence, nonconsensual sexual encounter, and harassment -- much higher risk [*[Senate File 418, p. 2](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=SF418)*]. For more information on this topic, see: "[Experiences of transgender prisoners and their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding sexual behaviors and HIV/STIs: A systematic review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6830990/)," "[A Crisis Behind Bars: Legal Issues Impacting Transgender People in Prisons](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/resources/magazine/2024-winter/crisis-behind-bars-legal-issues-impacting-transgender-people-prisons/)," "[Advancing Transgender Justice -- Illuminating Trans Lives Behind and Beyond Bars](https://www.vera.org/advancing-transgender-justice)," "[New Survey: Transgender People’s Experiences in Prison and Their Calls for Policy Change](https://www.vera.org/newsroom/new-survey-transgender-peoples-experiences-in-prison-and-their-calls-for-policy-change)," or a summary of that report "[What the Survey of Prison Inmates tells us about trans people in state prison](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2022/03/31/transgender_incarceration/)."  


### Iowa Legislature's/Governor's "Don't Come Here" Law & Follow-on Hostility  
With [Senate File 2340](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/publications/search/document?fq=id:1448304&q=%22Senate+File+2340%22) the Iowa Legislature and Governor created a new crime of "illegal reentry into state by certain aliens" and "[empowered **Iowa** prosecutors to bring charges in state court and **state** judges to order deportations](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=069409522_134f828)." Governor Reynolds [signed this bill into law 10 April 2024](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&ba=SF2340).  It says that anyone who has previously been deported, removed or denied admission to the United States and then enters Iowa, can be sent to prison in Iowa for up to 10 years and the judge in the case would have to order the convicted person to return to "the country they had come from." It also requires that anyone convicted of "[Illegal reentry into state by certain aliens](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/publications/search/document?fq=id:1448304&q=%22Senate+File+2340%22)" "shall not be eligible for a deferred judgment, deferred sentence, or suspended sentence."  

While the new law says law enforcement officers can't arrest someone if that individual is in a school, a place of worship, a health care facility, or a facility for survivors of sexual assault, it also provides civil immunity from liability and indemnification for local law enforcement and other government officials along with contractors responsible for enforcing the measure. That immunity appears to support behaviors that make Iowa an unwelcoming place for all who do not emit the visual and audio queues that signal "Iowan" to state and local officials (*...strongly suspect that means, for too many, "white without an accent"*).  


### Too Many Iowa Leaders Attack "Iowa Nice."  
If you have read down the page to this paragraph, you probably already know that [Iowa nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_nice) is, at least in part, a myth...  
President-elect Trump recently said that he would deport everyone in the U.S. without up-to-date federal government permission to be in the country, including any of their children who were born in the U.S.  Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has been a Trump and Trumpism enthusiast after the arrival of Covid-19 in 2020 [*[except for a short infatuation with Ron DeSantis in the pre-caucus 2024 Presidential campaign](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/19/kim-reynolds-trump-endorsements-00136372)*].  She [sent](https://apnews.com/article/iowa-guard-troops-texas-border-ce4b6127b24ecef7be46feeeb16af2e4) Iowa National Guard troops to Texas twice (*along with smaller groups of Iowa Department of Public Safety officers and Iowa State Patrol troopers*) to, in part, help Gov. Greg Abbott drive up the rate of death and maiming among populations attempting to cross the Rio Grand river by helping to ensure more [razor wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_wire) barriers were installed.  In mid-December 2024, Reynolds has pledged to [deploy "every tool"](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=1158e9da5_134d562) at her disposal to support Trump's (*and Tom Homan's*) mass deportation promises.  
["Iowa tees up for deportations -- Gov. promises to deploy 'every tool' for operation"](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=1158e9da5_134d562) by Sabine Martin.  

In early January 2025 an estimated 35,000 undocumented worked in Iowa.  As proposed in their recent campaigns Trump/Reynolds deportations could materially inhibit Iowa construction, health care, hotel, restaurants and other industries. Donnelle Eller and Kevin Baskins [wrote in the Des Moines Register](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=069409522_134f828) that  
>“Ag will be significantly impacted, because we rely on immigrant labor,” said Chad Hart, an Iowa State University agricultural economist. “We learned during COVID-19 that even slowing production down can have dramatic impacts that are felt by consumers across the nation.”  
>“Undocumented workers are not unemployed,” said Joe Enriquez Henry, president of the Latinos United of Iowa chapter in Des Moines. Many “are working in sectors that are dominated by big business interests.”  
>(*That is in spite of the fact that*) “the lack of labor force growth has been holding back the Iowa economy since the pandemic recovery began,” Orazem said. “Few states are more dependent on increasing immigration to grow or even maintain their workforces than Iowa.”  

In late March 2025 the Iowa Senate passed [Senate File 507](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=SF507), barring Iowa cities and counties from operating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices and prohibiting city and county governments from establishing, operating or maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices or contracting with a third-party to perform DEI services.  [SF 507](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=SF507) requires that C & C "shall not" do anything that implements or imploys or compels:  
>"policies, programs, trainings, practices, activities, or procedures referencing unconscious or implicit bias, cultural appropriation, allyship, transgender ideology, microaggressions, group marginalization, antiracism, systemic oppression, social justice, intersectionality, neopronouns, heteronormativity, disparate impact, gender theory, racial privilege, sexual privilege, or any related formulation of these concepts." [page 2](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=SF507)  
Republicans driving this legislation argued that it would "[combat unlawful racial discrimination in local governments](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=0379484f3_134f8fe)" even though they could produce no evidence or examples of DEI-induced or DEI-adjacent discrimination.  During debate on the bill, Republicans argued that it was needed so that Iowa cities and counties hired only "[the very best person](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=0379484f3_134f8fe)" for local government positions.  
From Trump 47's inauguration through 05-15-2025, [nine other states have enacted similar anti-DEI laws](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/15/red-states-join-trump-dei-fight/83518866007/).  
Kevin Baskins [reported on 02 Nov 2025 that](https://enewspaper.desmoinesregister.com?publink=0bf7e5408_134fc02):  
>"From July 2024 through July 2025, Iowa lost 5,400 manufacturing jobs and is down nearly 11,000 jobs since June 2023."  


### Representation in Washington  
[Laura Belin](https://www.bleedingheartland.com/author/laura-belin/) [wrote about](https://www.bleedingheartland.com/2025/01/19/who-had-joni-ernsts-ear-and-who-didnt-on-hegseth-nomination/) how in previous confirmation hearings U.S. Senator [Joni Ernst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Ernst) (R. IA) held senior military nominees to a standard that "demands the highest levels of trust and responsibility, of course sound judgment, and an impeccable moral compass."  But Sen. Ernst required none of those in the recent hearings for [Pete Hegseth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth)’s confirmation in the Senate Armed Services Committee and actively "discounted facts that raised doubts about his fitness while playing up a testimonial from someone with a stake in the outcome."  


### School Absenteeism  
Chronic absenteeism is having missed at least 10% of school days or instructional hours.  In late 2024 the statewide average for chronic absenteeism in Iowa is [21% of the student population](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?publink=031f19f7d_134d563) -- a number that represents additional challenges in the future for too many of those students, and illustrates weaknesses in student/family support systems.  During the 2024 legislative session, Iowa Republicans introduced [Senate File 2435](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&ba=SF2435) emphasizing charging and prosecuting parents of "Truant" students -- in Section 15, county attorneys are made responsible for enforcement of Iowa's truancy laws ("[has been absent from school, for any reason, for at least twenty percent of the days or hours in the grading period" [beginning on page 25](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&ba=SF2435).

That supports the quote below from an article by Courtney Crowder the [26 Nov. 2025 Des Moines Register](https://enewspaper.desmoinesregister.com?publink=0cdbf90c0_134fc1a):  
>"More and more Iowans are one crisis away from being in poverty, according to research from the United Way that dovetails with anecdotal evidence from Harrington’s member agencies.  In Iowa, the number of households below the federal poverty level increased by 6 percentage points between 2010 and 2023, the research found. And the number of households where employed workers’ incomes totaled more than the poverty level but less than the basic cost of living grew by 27%."  
* The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported December 12, 2024 that "[Real personal income](https://www.bea.gov/resources/methodologies/rpp) for the nation increased 2.1 percent in 2023," but relative to all other states "Iowa had the largest decline in real personal income, at –2.0 percent."
