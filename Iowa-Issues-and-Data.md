# Iowa Issues and Data  
*This is an early draft of topics of concern.*  

## Internet Connectivity  
I read wildly varying characterizations of Internet connectivity across the state of Iowa.  Because Internet connectivity is an important input to the success of education, business, and governing (democracy) of the state, it is critical that we have an unambiguous, trustworthy, shared understanding of its current state.  
'Ookla for Good' maintains an open data set that includes data on *Intetnet speeds* and *coverage* across the United States, including Iowa for both mobile and fixed Internet connections.  They gather their data via their *speedtest* application. Using this link: [https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good/open-data](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good/open-data) narrow the scope to "Iowa, United States" and choose a data set.  When comparing q4 2021 fixed and mobile Internet coverage data for Iowa against Wisconsin or Illinois (*or a number of other states*), too much of Iowa that is outside urban areas looks like a digital wasteland. 	
  * Not only is connectivity **coverage** limited in Iowa, but for **upload/download speeds**, Iowa was 44th (8th from the slowest) in the nation with median download speed of 38.81 Mbps and median upload 7.72 Mbps. [https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states#market-analysis](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states#market-analysis)  
  * Why use Ookla?  Given their descriptions of their data, it seems like a useful source for Internet connectivity data.  "Every day, over ten million unique tests are actively initiated by our users in the locations and at the times when their connectivity matters to them. Since our founding in 2006, an unparalleled total of more than 40 billion tests have been taken with Speedtest." [https://www.speedtest.net/about](https://www.speedtest.net/about) and "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide use Speedtest® to measure their internet connection. With over 18 million consumer-initiated tests taken daily and billions of data points gathered, Ookla® data paints a clear picture of the performance, quality, and availability of virtually every network in the world." [https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good)  
  * Raw data: "Speedtest by Ookla Global Fixed and Mobile Network Performance Maps." "Global fixed broadband and mobile (cellular) network performance, allocated to zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator). Data is provided in both Shapefile format as well as Apache Parquet with geometries represented in Well Known Text (WKT) projected in EPSG:4326. Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy."  Updated quarterly.

  * The SpeedTest client apps [https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli)  
    * And some speedtest scripts of varying sophistication:  
      * Speedtest-cli Python module [https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli)  
      * Shell Scripts To Install Speedtest_Cli [https://github.com/Socerest2/speedtestcli-sh](https://github.com/Socerest2/speedtestcli-sh)
