## Random Notes - No Source Code  

This is just a central repository for notes and lists that I want to access from a variety of endpoints and locations.  Many of these files are a mess as they evolve, but still meet my needs...  I have tried to name each file descriptively.  

License references and/or citations will be inserted into individual files as needed.  

### Hofstadter's Law still applies.  
Hofstadter's Law states that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."  From: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law)
