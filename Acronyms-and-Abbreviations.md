|Acronym or Abbreviation |Expanded Text |Context       |
|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 12b-1 Fees | fees paid out of mutual fund or ETF assets to cover the costs of marketing and selling mutual fund shares and sometimes to cover the costs of providing shareholder services. Distribution fees include fees to compensate brokers and others who sell fund shares and to pay for advertising, the printing and mailing of prospectuses to new investors, and the printing and mailing of sales literature. Shareholder Service Fees are fees paid to persons to respond to investor inquiries and provide investors with information about their investments.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Account Fee | a fee that some mutual funds separately charge investors for the maintenance of their accounts.  For example, accounts below a specified dollar amount may have to pay an account fee.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Authorized Participants | financial institutions, which are typically large broker-dealers, who enter into contractual relationships with ETFs to buy and redeem creation units of ETF shares.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Back-end Load | a sales charge (also known as a deferred sales charge) investors pay when they redeem (or sell) mutual fund shares; generally used by the mutual fund to compensate brokers.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Brokers | an individual who acts as an intermediary between a buyer and seller, usually charging a commission to execute trades.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Brokerage Commissions | A fee investors pay their brokers with each purchase or sale of ETF shares. | mutual fund and ETF investing |

Each class invests in the same pool (or investment portfolio) of securities and has the same investment objectives and policies. But each class has different shareholder services and/or distribution arrangements with different fees and expenses and therefore different performance results.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Closed-End Fund | a type of investment company that does not continuously offer its shares for sale but instead sells a fixed number of shares at one time (in the initial public offering) which then typically trade on a secondary market, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market – legally known as a closed-end investment company.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Contingent Deferred Sales Load | a type of back-end load, the amount of which depends on the length of time the investor held his or her mutual fund shares.  For example, a contingent deferred sales load might be (X)% if an investor holds his or her shares for one year, (X-1)% after two years, and so on until the load reaches zero and goes away completely.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Conversion | a feature some mutual funds offer that allows investors to automatically change from one class to another (typically with lower annual expenses) after a set period of time.  The mutual fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus will state whether a class ever converts to another class.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Creation Units | large blocks of shares of an ETF, typically 50,000 shares or more, usually sold in in-kind exchanges to Authorized Participants.| mutual fund and ETF investing |

Your financial professional or broker can also provide you with a copy.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Purchase Fee | a shareholder fee that some mutual funds charge when investors purchase mutual fund shares.  Not the same as (and may be in addition to) a front-end load.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Redemption Fee | a shareholder fee that some mutual funds charge when investors redeem (or sell) mutual fund shares within a certain time frame of purchasing the shares. Redemption fees (which must be paid to the fund) are not the same as (and may be in addition to) a back-end load (which is typically paid to a broker). The SEC generally limits redemption fees to 2%.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
| Sales Charge (or Load) | the amount that investors pay when they purchase (front-end load) or redeem (back-end load) shares in a mutual fund, similar to a brokerage commission.| mutual fund and ETF investing |

| Unit Investment Trust (UIT) | a type of investment company that typically makes a one-time public offering of only a specific, fixed number of units.  A UIT will terminate and dissolve on a date established when the UIT is created (although some may terminate more than fifty years after they are created).  UITs do not actively trade their investment portfolios.| mutual fund and ETF investing |
