# Senator Chuck Grassley's Supreme Court  

Chuck Grassley, an elderly U.S. Senator (*and lifetime politician*) from Iowa, led the schemes to delay and deny confirmation hearings for those nominated to Federal judgeships by Democratic U.S. Presidents, and to expedite those nominated by Republicans (*Neil Gorsuch after Grassley action on Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland for nine months and Barrett after Grassley helped rush through her confirmation in 30 days, just ahead of the 2020 election*).  This has resulted in a Supreme Court whose behaviors document a practice of ignoring long-standing precedent (*decades of judicial decisions*) while reshaping existing law and applying Far Right soup of *legal frameworks* for the United States -- rejecting consideration of race in the law, finding discrimination in the separation of church and state and in constraints on gun ownership and in anything that impinges on what they view as the U.S. constition's "colorblindness," shrinking the scope of U.S. regulatory agencies, and simple support for anti-abortion actions.  

Altogether, Grassley's Supreme Court now has a majority of activist judges legislating from the bench -- rewriting laws it doesn’t like, ignoring statutory text that is inconvenient, cherry-picking historical fact sets to support their new narratives.

### On-Deck for 2022  
* The constitutionality of race-conscious college admissions programs  
* The constitionality of controls to ensure that state legislative and congressional district lines are drawn fairly (*primarily Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act*)  
* The constitionality of constraints on "*religious liberties*" and/or "*gay rights*," or simply *when discrimination must be tolerated*  
* The constitionality of constraints on partisan gerrymandering (*and a chance for the Far Right Supreme Court to implement the “independent state legislature theory,” and therefore the constitionality of legislative election subversion*)
