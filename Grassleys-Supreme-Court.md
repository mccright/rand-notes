# Senator Chuck Grassley's Supreme Court  

Chuck Grassley, an elderly U.S. Senator (*and lifetime politician*) from Iowa, led the schemes to delay and deny confirmation hearings for those nominated to Federal judgeships by Democratic U.S. Presidents, and to expedite those nominated by Republicans (*Neil Gorsuch after Grassley action on Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland for nine months and Barrett after Grassley helped rush through her confirmation in 30 days, just ahead of the 2020 election*).  This has resulted in a Supreme Court whose behaviors document a practice of ignoring long-standing precedent (*decades of judicial decisions*) while reshaping existing law and applying Far Right soup of *legal frameworks* for the United States -- rejecting consideration of race in the law, finding discrimination in the separation of church and state and in constraints on gun ownership and in anything that impinges on what they view as the U.S. constition's "colorblindness," shrinking the scope of U.S. regulatory agencies, and simple support for anti-abortion actions.  

Altogether, Grassley's Supreme Court now has a majority of activist judges legislating from the bench -- rewriting laws it doesn’t like, ignoring statutory text that is inconvenient, cherry-picking historical fact sets to support their new narratives.  Grassley's Supreme Court also [cheery-picks (*even invents*) a material portion of the questions they will address in the cases that they accept for review](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/us/supreme-court-cases.html) -- converting the court into a political, rather than judicial force, and robbing plaintiffs of having "**their**" cases decided.  Grassley's court makes partisan policy rather than searching for justice and all Americans are robbed of a fundamental right.
