# Build Tooling  

There are many options for application build tooling.  Anyone involved in application security (*which includes everyone involved in developing and maintaining, even deploying applications*) needs at least a passing familiarity with risk-appropriate use of their build tools.  There is an increasingly broad spectrum of Internet-hosted services that incorporate some or all of the features developers require of build tooling.  That said, a lot of hands-on development still occurs on one or another type of user endpoint (*whether it be a virtual or physical endpoing*).  
Anyone wanting to specialize in *application security* work should have some awareness of what is required to build a range of application types in across a range of development languages and frameworks.  Here is a list of the build tool kits that I have run into in the course of my application security work in recent years.  It is not meant to be comprehensive...
