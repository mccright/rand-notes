Focus on Facts and Restrict the Flow of Misinformation
------------------------------------------------------
Do your part to resist and constrain the flow of misinformation.  During outbreaks like the current COVID-19 pandemic -- a global population-level disaster -- the spread of information that is known to be incorrect can lead to unhealthy, even fatal behaviors and reinforce disinformation used to drive people to mistrust scientists and governments *and each other.*  Misinformation and disinformation results in participant's being less likely to follow fact-based advisories and to take appropriate precautions.  
This is critically important in North America.  As of late June 2020, U.S.A. had 4% of the world’s population and 25% of the world’s deaths from COVID-19 and in late August the proportions remained similar.  Unfortunately, the rate of disease spread has only increased since then.  Compounding the challenge, in a Sept 2020 Pew Research poll, [49% of Americans said they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated at this time](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/17/u-s-public-now-divided-over-whether-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/).  That percentage remains stubbornly high.  In early February 2021, the U.S.A. [hovered around 120,000 new cases per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases) and from [3,500 to more than 5,000 COVID deaths per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendsdeaths). At the end of March those nubmers were [60,000](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases) and [1,000](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendsdeaths) respectively along with almost [33,000](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations) hospitalizations with confirmed covid and the [Cumulative Incidence Rate of COVID-19 Cases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratecasessevendayrate) is beginning to trend upward again.  The vaccine rollout is going to take time (remember, we are one globe & a high percentage of earth's population needs to be vaccinated) -- while the scale of resistance to vaccination remains uncertain.  Some states have removed virtually all COVID-19 health-related directives at a time when new, more contageous variants of the virus are spreading.  These seem like strong indicators of a material failure to engage with the realities of the current COVID-19 pandemic.  
Vaccinations are like local and global health gold.  Every case of Covid-19 that is prevented by an individual being fully vaccinated cuts off transmission chains and prevents many more future cases.  Sufficient concentrations of vaccinated individuals can cause exponential decay in Covid-19 transmission and cases.  Populations need to continue to focus on vaccinating absolutely every one possible as well as using the rest of available means to slow/resist virus transmission.

What you can do?  
================
***...as an individual***  
FROM: [https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-13?n=10](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-13?n=10)  
* Practice strict social distancing, especially if you are in a vulnerable group.  Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.  Resist the urge to give in to your urge to travel/shop/eat out/etc.  
* Wear a cloth mask as an integral part of your social distancing efforts (donate your N95s). (see "Masks Help" section below)  
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine. Avoid all nonessential travel.  
* Communicate your feelings about the pace of getting vaccines into people's arms to your local, state, and national leaders.  
* Get vaccinated as soon as a vaccine is available to you. [I just got an appointment -- next Thursday -- for my first vaccine jab]  
* If you are an employer, remember that at least 35 percent of infected people have no symptoms at all, so they will not be caught by your assessment or surveillance efforts (and in some workplaces the percentage of symptom-free infected in a given employer's workforce have been more than twice that level) and they could unknowingly infect other people.  Encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible, and encourage & support healthy lifestyles.  Encourage your governmental leaders to prioritize getting vaccines into people's arms sooner.  

**...as an individual, manage your risk**  
FROM: from Dr. Leana S. Wen [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/21/four-concepts-assess-your-personal-risk-us-reopens/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/21/four-concepts-assess-your-personal-risk-us-reopens/)  
Here are four risk management concepts to help focus our harm-reduction strategies and to help guide our decisions:  
* *Relative risk*. For covid-19, Dr. Wen suggests considering our risk through three key variables: proximity, activity and time. You can decrease your risk by modifying one or more of these three variables.  A variation on this by Dr. Bill Miller, an epidemiologist and a physician at Ohio State University includes: Time, space, people and place.
  * Businesses should also heed this principle as they are reopening, by keeping up telecommuting and staggered shifts, reducing capacity in conference rooms, and closing communal dining areas.  Business leaders need to understand and integrate (*at this time*) a critical mass of hard science reports that least 35 percent of infected people have no symptoms at all, so they will not be caught by typical assessment or surveillance efforts (and in some workplaces the percentage of symptom-free COVID-19 infected individuals in a given employer's workforce have been more than twice that level) and they could unknowingly infect other people.
* *Pooled risk*. If you engage in high-risk activity and are around others who do the same, you increase everyone’s risk. As applied to COVID-19, this means those who have very low exposure are probably safe to associate with one another.  
  * The equation changes when any one individual resumes higher-risk activities — returning to work outside the home, for example.  Recently, add participation in protests where individuals distancing is minimized, shouting is common, and there are instances where  police or related *others* fire pepper spray, tear gas, or other chemical *irritants* to disperse crowds, causing demonstrators to start coughing.  This will be a challenge for businesses' surveillance systems, as it is not easy to tease out evidence of elevated risk behaviors in any given worker's *off hours*.  It is, though, critically important to try.  
* *Cumulative risk*. Your risk of acquiring COVID-19 is additive for every person you come into close contact with.  
  * Many people must return to work, but they can still reduce their risk overall by not having social gatherings inside or outside of work. Choose the activities most important to you.  
* *Collective risk*.  Individual actions are crucial, but they do not replace the need for sound public policy.  The higher the rate of COVID-19 in a community, the more likely any one individual you come into contact with has the virus and the riskier your interactions become.  
  * This is why mask-wearing is important: If most people wear a mask [*covering both mouth and nose*], it reduces the amount of virus that we will transmit and may also help protect the wearer from contracting the disease. (see "Masks Help" section below)  
  * Employers must have science-supported assessment and surveillance systems in place to detect if and when infections rise and be willing to discontinue work-at-the-office experiments, or further diffuse (increase individual isolation) the existing on-site workforce.  This is a challenge because a critical mass of hard science reports that at least 35 percent of infected people have no symptoms at all.  


***...as an official***  
* Focus on rapidly [increasing the pace](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends) of getting vaccines into people's arms.  The health and welfare of your constituents, their businesses and the broader economy depend upon dramatically increasing the rate of vaccine delivery.  
* Create and publicize a realistic strategy and accompanying plan for how vaccination will scale up to required delivery rates.  Incorporate into that plan the means to learn what works and where challenges exist, and then immediately course-correct.  Help residents find vaccination sites and get vaccinated on schedule ([the vaccinefinder.org is an example of how you might start](https://vaccinefinder.org/), see: [https://vaccinefinder.org/search/](https://vaccinefinder.org/search/)).  Set up a real-time public dashboard to track vaccine distribution to help hold the right officials accountable and to assist directing the right resources where they are needed (paraphrasing [a plea by Leana S. Wen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/29/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-slow-testing/)).  
* Make testing free and broadly available, and support efforts to increase testing accuracy. [*You can do this.  The combination of testing and contact tracing is less expensive than hospitalizations.*  Testing only individuals in a small, ill-defined subset of your communities will not help leaders make informed-enough decisions about 'what next' and may result in decisions that negatively impact population health and mortality*.  Engaging in evasive *word games* about the nature and extent of testing, or denying facts about the scope and effectiveness of your testing efforts are counterproductive behaviors.  Factor in the fact that (*at this time*) a critical mass of hard science reports that at least 35% of infected individuals show no symptoms.]  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place and stress that wearing cloth masks [*covering both mouth and nose*] are an integral part of your social distancing efforts.  Model safe behaviors at all times and require the same of all those working in your organization.  Keep these measures in place until medical science supports a change in strategy. (see "Masks Help" section below)  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts. [*Without this, leaders cannot make informed-enough decisions about 'what next' and may result in decisions that negatively impact population health and mortality*.  *Testing and contact tracing is less expensive and more humane than hospitalizations.*]  
* Fund & then implement the purchase and formal coordination of PPE distribution to minimize waste and contention for limited resources.  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures.  
  * There are a broad range of financial issues that need your attention.  Many of them are fiendishly complex.  
    * One that is especially and increasingly time-critical is how to deal with increasing numbers of evictions - and the associated family and homelessness issues [https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/)  
* Use available resources to analyze your current state and plan.  For example the Covid-Local Metrics for Phased Reopening: [https://covid-local.org/metrics/](https://covid-local.org/metrics/), [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html#table1](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html#table1), and [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html#table2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html#table2)    
* Keep reviewing the state of COVID-19 related medical science, as well as your goals, tactics and strategies.  Maintaining available hospital capacity or meeting economic growth targets are not the most critical goals.  Maintaining public health is more important.  Human life has value -- keep that in focus at all times.  Using the words '*transparent*' or '*proactive*' are not the same as being transparent or proactive in your decision-making and actions.  Honesty, transparency, and being open to learning & change will earn you far more long lasting loyalty and compliance than any other behaviors.  
* Learn what executing a broad vaccination campaign means and requires.  
* Fund and implement comprehensive vaccination planning and implementation -- this includes formal coordination of vaccine distribution and its administration all the way through injection into humans (and re-injection, as needed).  This work requires consistent focus and strong managerial efforts across your sphere of responsibility and far beyond.  [Success is not guaranteed](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/).  Lean into this work and be a leader -- whatever your formal role.  
* Remain humble.  Too many people for which you are responsible are getting sick.  Too many of them will die or will be haunted by life-altering after-effects of the disease.  Your decisions, your actions influence the impacts of the pandemic.  Engage in regular rigorous self-reflection, soul-searching, and self-appraisal.  Are you identifying the right investments?  Are you setting the right priorities?

***...as an employer***  
* Encourage your governmental leaders to prioritize getting vaccines into people's arms sooner.  For most of you, the health of your business and the broader economy depend upon it.  
* Create and publicize a realistic strategy and accompanying plan for getting your employees vaccinated.  Incorporate into that plan the means to learn what is working and where challenges exist, and then immediately course-correct.  Set up a near-real-time dashboard to track employee vaccination injections to help hold yourself and your team accountable and to assist directing the right resources where they are needed (paraphrasing [a plea by Leana S. Wen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/29/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-slow-testing/).  
* Support work-from-home for as many roles as is possible, for as long as is practical.  
* Use the CDC "COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings" guidelines as an initial outline to structure your workplace preparation and operations. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html)  
* Spread of COVID-19 appears to be driven through airborne transmission of aerosols produced by asymptomatic individuals during breathing and speaking.  Coughing and droplets are dangerous, but aerosols can accumulate, remain infectious in indoor air for hours, and be easily inhaled deep into the lungs [[ref]](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1422).  Only specialized air-handling will effectively deal with these aerosols in the workplace.  ASHRAE has [actionable guidance](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources) on this topic.  Far-UVC light (207-222 nm) may may also play a role in safely inactivating airborne COVID-19[[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67211-2).  
* Learn what executing a broad vaccination campaign means and requires.  You may have a role.  [Success is not guaranteed](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/).  Help promote comprehensive participation in vaccination campaigns. Lean into this work and be a leader -- whatever your formal role.  
* You are an individual and an official as well as an employer - use all the bullets above.  
* Focus on rapidly [increasing the pace](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends) of getting vaccines into people's arms.  For many of you, your business success, your revenue and profits depend upon it.  The health and welfare of your employees, customers, partners, service providers, suppliers, their businesses and the broader economy depend upon dramatically increasing the rate of vaccine delivery.

**Masks Help**  
"*Face masks: what the data say.*" By Lynne Peeples  
(The science supports that face coverings are saving lives during the coronavirus pandemic, and yet the debate trundles on. How much evidence is enough?) [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8)  
Quotes and supporting references:  
"A preprint study posted in early August (and not yet peer reviewed), found that weekly increases in per-capita mortality were four times lower in places where masks were the norm or recommended by the government, compared with other regions." See: Leffler, C. T. et al. Preprint at medRxiv [https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231) (2020).  
"Another study looked at the effects of US state-government mandates for mask use in April and May. Researchers estimated that those reduced the growth of COVID-19 cases by up to 2 percentage points per day. They cautiously suggest that mandates might have averted as many as 450,000 cases, after controlling for other mitigation measures, such as physical distancing."  Lyu, W. & Wehby, G. L. Health Aff. [https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818](https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818) (2020) and at: [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.1377%2Fhlthaff.2020.00818](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.1377%2Fhlthaff.2020.00818)  
"Gandhi co-authored a paper published in late July suggesting that masking reduces the dose of virus a wearer might receive, resulting in infections that are milder or even asymptomatic.

[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06067-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06067-8) (2020) and at [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.1007%2Fs11606-020-06067-8](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.1007%2Fs11606-020-06067-8)  

**Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness**  
Vaccine safety, relative to many other common activities, remains high and remains heavily supported by facts.  The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program [https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html](https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html), has been in place since the 1980s to financially compensate people for serious adverse vaccine reactions[https://www.justice.gov/civil/vicp](https://www.justice.gov/civil/vicp).  Its activities have established a foundation of evidence about the frequency of vaccine-caused harm.  Between 2006 and 2018 in the U.S, there were 5,317 compensable concessions, court decisions, or settlements out of more than 3.7 billion vaccinations [https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/data-statistics-report.pdf](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/data-statistics-report.pdf). It works out to be about one compensable reaction per every 695,000 doses of any particular vaccine.  Most individuals living in the U.S. routinely participate in many activities that involve much worse odds than that.  
The [CDC reported](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccine%20breakthrough%20infections,43%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories.) that as of April 13, 2021, more than 75 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 since December 14, 2020.  During the same time, CDC received 5,814 reports of vaccine breakthrough infections.  That is roughly 1 case in 12,900 vaccinations, or 0.0078% -- a remarkably low rate.  Around 30% of those breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, 7% required hospitalization (0.00054% of those fully vaccinated), and 1 percent of those breakthrough infected died (0.000077% of those fully vaccinated).  These vaccinations are far safer than numerous common activities that most of us engage in every day.  
On April 13, 2021, [CDC and FDA recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/) a pause in the use of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) out of an abundance of caution while they review data involving a small number -- around 1 in a million -- of U.S. reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia (*'a weird clot'*) in individuals after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [met on April 14](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/janssen-faqs.html).  After hearing additional data on these reports, ACIP agreed that more information is needed before policy recommendations can be made regarding the continued use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.  CDC will collect more information and convene another ACIP meeting on April 23 to review any additional scientific evidence.  This level of caution seems like a good behavior and should support trust in the outcome.  
Use caution when you see or hear negative information about vaccines.  Anti-vaccine myth-making is highly concentrated.  Just [twelve anti-vaxxers are responsible for almost two-thirds of anti-vaccine content circulating on social media platforms](https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen).  Their disinformation is a direct threat to public health.  Please ignore them and share that sentiment with those around you.  

**COVID-19 Fatality Rate**  
COVID-19 is far more lethal than seasonal flu. About [1.7% of *diagnosed* coronavirus cases are lethal](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality), compared with 0.1% of diagnosed flu cases.  Scientists argue that the number of people infected is far higher than the number who receive an official diagnoses which results in a lower death rates.  In that context, the CDC estimates that the U.S. COVID-19 death rate is around 0.65% -- compared to flu’s 0.025% fatality rate.  Because The U.S. maintains high rates of infection, that 0.65% fatality rate has produced at least [564,000 deaths](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home) (2021 Apr 19) in the U.S. alone (with at least 2.4 million world-wide).  Differences in the rates of infection throughout given populations results in widely varying ["deaths/100,000" rates](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#global-counts-rates) -- highlighting *the importance of managing risks*.  

**Herd Immunity**  
Herd immunity is about reaching vaccination thresholds needed to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission.  
There is still uncertainty, but most scientists use high percentages - 75% to, more recently 90% fully vaccinated.  
Unfortunately, anti-intellectual hostility to vaccines plus political hostility to COVID-19 vaccination appear to remove herd immunity as a practical goal.  
Polls have found that ~20% of self-identified Democrats and more than 50% of Republicans are unlikely to participate in COVID-19 vaccination.  One in five Americans continue to say they’re "not at all likely to get the vaccine," a figure that has barely budged since the beginning of 2021, according to an Axios-Ipsos poll in April 2021.  
Current scientific understanding projects that in areas where vaccinations are low, COVID-19 virus will continue to thrive and mutate, increasing the probability of harm in those areas and beyond (we remain one earth).  
Even in that pessimistic outlook, the broader the pools of immunity we achieve, the better off we'll all be.  Learn about the fantastic successes of currently-available vaccines -- and get vaccinated as soon as is practical for you.  

**Resist Participating in Efforts to Use COVID-19 Health Measures into Wedge Issues**  
Birthing or nurturing COVID-19 health measures into wedge issues is harmful for all of us.  It harms our health as well as societal cohesion, and it is used by some to weaken democracy.  Resist these ideas and communications -- it will make you (and the rest of us) safer and healthier.  
Don't initiate or participate in attempts to divide people or groups on wearing masks.  This has led to physical confrontations, attacks, and arrests.  See "Masks Help" above.  
Don't initiate or participate in attempts to divide people or groups on being vaccinated.  Approved COVID-19 vaccinations are highly safe and effective.  They involve far less risk of injury or death than many, many common activities.  See "Vaccine Safety" above.  
Don't initiate or participate in attempts to divide people or groups on so-called "vaccine passports."  Businesses, all levels of government, and private organizations are all struggling with policies and practices that will help them "open up" as COVID-19 risks recede.  One thread of that activity involves evidence of immunization against COVID-19.  Vaccination-status is part of a broader category of private health-related information, but no serious efforts to deal with *opening up* involve exposing all personal health information to routine verification.  If you have strong feelings on this topic, help figure it out -- it is an important issue that could benefit from diverse inputs.

**Historical Notes**  
* In early January 2020 the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, in collaboration with the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control, and the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia released a coronavirus genome from a case of a respiratory disease from the Wuhan outbreak (Jan 6th or 10th) [http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319](http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319) and scientists began studying it for opportunities almost immediately, for example: [https://twitter.com/k_stephensonMD/status/1348459874196320257/](https://twitter.com/k_stephensonMD/status/1348459874196320257/)  
* This is not the first pandemic of this nature.  There were quite a few others in addition to the well-known 1918-1919 Flu pandemic.  See "The Flu -- A brief history of influenza in U.S. America, Europe, Hawaii." By A. Mouritz, 1921, hosted on [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61607/61607-h/61607-h.htm](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61607/61607-h/61607-h.htm)  
   Quote: "MAIN FACTOR OF SPREAD. Not the Weather, but HUMAN intercourse, especially Commerce; the greater the speed of Commerce, the greater and quicker is the spread of the Flu; it follows the path of HUMAN travel; it is a Contagion solely spread by HUMAN intercourse, viz. 'The Influenza Carrier or Carriers.'  
   Positions in life, which require contact with Travelers, necessarily influence and spread the disease.  
   'Flu' is spread in the same ratio of speed as the Carrier of IT.  
   When the Flu is a weakling, his best Nurses and Foster-Mothers are Overcrowding and lack of Pure Air.  
   Where the Crowd is, there the Flu is: little crowding means little Flu; plenty of Crowding, plenty of Flu."
