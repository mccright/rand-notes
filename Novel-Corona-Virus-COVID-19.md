Focus on Facts and Restrict the Flow of Misinformation
------------------------------------------------------
```
Get vaccinated.  Help your family and friends do the same.  
Get boosted.  Help your family and friends do the same.  
Ventilate spaces.  
Avoid crowds.  
Use masks.  
Test if you have symptoms.  
Isolate if you are positive.  
Support global vaccine distribution.  Pockets of unvaccinated are reservoirs for the virus and where new variants evolve.  
```
Do your part to resist and constrain the flow of misinformation.  During outbreaks like the current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic -- a global population-level health crisis caused by airborne pathogens -- the spread of information that is known to be incorrect can lead to unhealthy, even fatal behaviors and reinforce disinformation used to drive people to mistrust scientists and governments *and each other.*  Misinformation and disinformation results in participant's being less likely to follow fact-based advisories and to take appropriate precautions.  

This is critically important in North America where we continue to contribute heavily to the World's pool of Covid-19 deaths along with a growing pool of individuals struggling with chronic illness associated with their Covid-19 experience.  As of late June 2020, U.S.A. had 4% of the world’s population and 25% of the world’s deaths from COVID-19 and in late August 2020 the proportions remained similar.  Unfortunately, the rate of disease continued to spread through 2020 and beyond.  Compounding the challenge, in a Sept 2020 Pew Research poll, [49% of Americans said they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated at this time](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/17/u-s-public-now-divided-over-whether-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/).  While that attitude has morphed over time, the percentage of the U.S. population resisting vaccination remains stubbornly high.  In a [Monmouth University poll released in April, 2021](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_041421/), 21% of Americans say they will never get the vaccine if they can avoid it.  According to an [Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released in late July 2021](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-science-health-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-36ea18ee3a3397da7edd5b8249f0e477)," among American adults who have not yet received a vaccine, 35% say they probably will not, and 45% say they definitely will not" -- and that "64% of unvaccinated Americans have little to no confidence the shots are effective against variants — including the delta variant that officials say is responsible for 83% of new cases in the U.S. — despite evidence that they offer strong protection." The late August 2021 [Axios-Ipsos Coronavirus poll](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index) finds fewer Americans outright reject getting a COVID-19 vaccine: "20% Americans say they are not likely to get the coronavirus vaccine, the lowest level since we started tracking. Hard opposition, those not at all likely, has dropped to 14% of adults."  

In early February 2021, the U.S.A. [hovered around 120,000 new cases per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases) and from [3,500 to more than 5,000 COVID deaths per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendsdeaths). At the end of March those nubmers were [60,000](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases) and [1,000](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendsdeaths) respectively along with almost [33,000](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations) hospitalizations with confirmed covid and the [Cumulative Incidence Rate of COVID-19 Cases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratecasessevendayrate) was beginning to trend upword again.  On May 1, [there were 50,000 new cases per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases), [35,000 hospitalizations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations) and [635 deaths](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases). 15 days later the numbers were 30,000, 26,000, and 346 respectively.  Another 15 days later the numbers were 18,900, 21,600, and 442 respectively -- a generally positive (but still grim) trend.  The combination of the delta variant, widespread unsafe behaviors (some state mandated), and large numbers of unvaccinated individuals resulted in steeply increasing suffering throughout the Summer of 2021 -- the 7-day average peaking in September at more than [160,000 cases per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases), and [1,800 COVID-19 deaths per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailydeaths), along with [93,578 hospitalizations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations).  

As of October 31, 2021 we were down from those peaks to 7-day averages of [69,657 cases per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases), and [1,104 COVID-19 deaths per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailydeaths|new_death|select) [45,106 hospitalizations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations) per day along with [5,273 **new** COVID-19 hospitalizations per day](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations) (2021-10-31).  

The vaccine rollout is going to take time (remember, we are one globe & a high percentage of earth's population needs to be vaccinated) -- while the scale of resistance to vaccination remains uncertain.  Currently (2021-08-30) more than 1000 Americans die each day from COVID-19 (like crashing at least two wide-body jets every day).  Some states have removed many COVID-19 health-related directives at a time when new, more contageous variants of the virus are spreading rapidly. And tens of millions of Americans have chosen to remain unvaccinated leaving as many as 1,000 counties with vaccination rates below 30%. These seem like strong indicators of a material failure to engage with the realities of the current COVID-19 pandemic.  

Vaccinations have powerful local and global health impacts.  Every case of Covid-19 that is prevented by an individual being fully vaccinated cuts off transmission chains and prevents many more future cases.  Sufficient concentrations of vaccinated individuals can cause exponential decay in Covid-19 transmission and cases.  Populations need to continue to focus on vaccinating absolutely every individual possible as well as using the rest of available means to slow/resist virus transmission.  There has been progress.  In late November 2021, [42% of all humans (at least 3.32 billion people) have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and another 11% (896.79 million) are partially vaccinated](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL).  

Regional COVID-19 crises continue and deserve our attention, compassion and our aid.  They have material potential for creating new COVID variants -- some of which may evade our vaccines.  Overall, COVID-19 is still a potent global killer -- more people died of it in 2021 than it did in all of 2020 (2021-06-15).  More than [7,500 COVID deaths per day worldwide](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/) is an enormous burden.  It is in all our interests to achieve high rates of vaccination in every population on the globe.  Kevin Watkins, CEO of Save the Children UK [builds a useful argument for and a practical proposal to advance the goal of global vaccination](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ending-trickle-down-vaccine-economics-by-kevin-watkins-2021-09).

What you can do?  
================
***...as an individual***  
FROM: [https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-13?n=10](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-13?n=10)  
* Practice strict social distancing, especially if you are in a vulnerable group.  Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.  Resist the urge to give in to your urge to travel/shop/eat out/etc.  
* Wear a cloth mask as an integral part of your social distancing efforts (donate your N95s). (see "Masks Help" section below)  
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine. Avoid all nonessential travel.  
* Communicate your feelings about the pace of getting vaccines into people's arms to your local, state, and national leaders.  
* Get vaccinated!  Getting and maintaining full COVID-19 vaccination status is critically important to your health and to the health of others.  Get vaccinated as soon as a vaccine is available to you.    
* If you are an employer, remember that at least 35 percent of infected people have no symptoms at all, so they will not be caught by your driveby assessment or surveillance efforts (*and in some workplaces the percentage of symptom-free infected in a given employer's workforce have been more than twice that level*) and they could unknowingly infect other people.  *Nearly universal vaccination* is the only clear path to employee and customer safety.  Use all means available to get your employees and their families vaccinated.  The Federal worker mandate demonstrated that mandates work -- as over 90% of federal workers received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the Nov. 22, 2021 deadline.  If you have employees who are in regions where vaccination remains problematic, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible, and encourage & support healthy lifestyles.  Encourage your governmental leaders to prioritize getting vaccines into more people's arms sooner, and to expand those efforts globally.  

**...as an individual, manage your risk**  
FROM: from Dr. Leana S. Wen [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/21/four-concepts-assess-your-personal-risk-us-reopens/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/21/four-concepts-assess-your-personal-risk-us-reopens/)  
Here are four risk management concepts to help focus our harm-reduction strategies and to help guide our decisions:  
* *Relative risk*. For covid-19, Dr. Wen suggests considering our risk through three key variables: proximity, activity and time. You can decrease your risk by modifying one or more of these three variables.  A variation on this by Dr. Bill Miller, an epidemiologist and a physician at Ohio State University includes: Time, space, people and place.  
  * Businesses should also heed this principle as they are reopening, by requiring members of their workforce get fully vaccinated, by keeping up telecommuting and staggered shifts, reducing capacity in conference rooms, and closing communal dining areas.  Business leaders need to understand and integrate (*at this time*) a critical mass of hard science reports that least 35 percent of infected people have no symptoms at all, so they will not be caught by typical assessment or surveillance efforts (and in some workplaces the percentage of symptom-free COVID-19 infected individuals in a given employer's workforce have been more than twice that level) and they could unknowingly infect other people.  
* *Pooled risk*. If you engage in high-risk activity and are around others who do the same, you increase everyone’s risk. As applied to COVID-19, this means those who have very low exposure are probably at reduced risk when associating with one another.  Getting everyone in your circle of exposures fully vaccinated (especially in your work environment, your social circles, and if applicable your childred's schools and/or care-givers) can materially drive down your risk of serious COVID illness and/or death.  
  * The equation changes when any one individual resumes higher-risk activities — returning to work outside the home, for example.  Recently, add participation in protests where individuals distancing is minimized, shouting is common, and there are instances where  police or related *others* fire pepper spray, tear gas, or other chemical *irritants* to disperse crowds, causing demonstrators to start coughing.  This will be a challenge for businesses' surveillance systems, as it is not easy to tease out evidence of elevated risk behaviors in any given worker's *off hours*.  It is, though, critically important to try.  
* *Cumulative risk*. Your risk of acquiring COVID-19 is additive for every person you come into close contact with.  Those risks are materially amplified in the presence of any unvaccinated individuals.  
  * Many people must return to work, but they can still reduce their risk overall by getting vaccinated (and advocating for the same across your local workforce), by not having social gatherings inside or outside of work. Choose the activities most important to you.  
* *Collective risk*.  Individual actions are crucial, but they do not replace the need for sound public policy.  The higher the rate of COVID-19 in a community, the more likely any one individual you come into contact with has the virus and the riskier your interactions become.  
  * This is why getting vaccinated is so critically important: If 95% of the population is fully vaccinated COVID-19 transmission would be materially reduced, COVID-19 variant evolution would slow, and our collective risk would be reduced to pre-pandemic levels.  
  * This is why mask-wearing is important (because too many individuals remain unvaccinated which drives COVID-19 transmission and evolution): If most people wear a mask [*covering both mouth and nose*], it reduces the amount of virus that we will transmit and *may* also help protect the wearer from contracting the disease. (see "Masks Help" section below)  
  * Employers must have science-supported assessment and surveillance systems in place to detect if and when infections rise and be willing to enforce more strict vaccination requirements, and/or discontinue work-at-the-office experiments, or further diffuse (increase individual isolation) the existing on-site workforce.  This is a challenge because a critical mass of hard science reports that at least 35 percent of infected people have no symptoms at all.  


***...as an official***  
* Focus on rapidly [increasing the pace](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends) of getting vaccines into people's arms.  The health and welfare of your constituents, their businesses and the broader economy depend upon dramatically increasing the rate of vaccine delivery.  *The unvaccinated* are a barrier to 'getting back to normal' -- or achieving any number of positive goals.  Invest in efforts to get them vaccinated.  Support the recent Federal vaccination mandates.  
* Create and publicize a realistic strategy and accompanying plan for how vaccination will scale up to required delivery rates.  Incorporate into that plan the means to learn what works and where challenges exist, and then immediately course-correct.  Help residents find vaccination sites and get vaccinated on schedule ([the vaccinefinder.org is an example of how you might start](https://vaccinefinder.org/), see: [https://vaccinefinder.org/search/](https://vaccinefinder.org/search/)).  Set up a real-time public dashboard to track vaccine distribution to help hold the right officials accountable and to assist directing the right resources where they are needed (paraphrasing [a plea by Leana S. Wen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/29/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-slow-testing/)).  
* Make testing free and broadly available, and support efforts to increase testing accuracy.  Incorporate surveillance testing into your overall testing budget and work with scientists to determine the nature and scope of that testing. [*You can do this.  The combination of testing and contact tracing is less expensive than hospitalizations.*  Testing only individuals in a small, ill-defined subset of your communities will not help leaders make informed-enough decisions about 'what next' and may result in decisions that negatively impact population health and mortality*.  Engaging in evasive *word games* about the nature and extent of testing, or denying facts about the scope and effectiveness of your testing efforts are counterproductive behaviors.  Factor in the fact that (*at this time*) a critical mass of hard science reports that at least 35% of infected individuals show no symptoms.]  Ignore those politicians who have cancelled testing as part of their anti-intellectual or conspiracy  promotions.  In Iowa, for example, the governor rejected tens of millions in U.S. government funding and decided surveillance testing for coronavirus infections should be severely limited, and recently called Federal action mandating vaccinations for some "dangerous and unprecedented."  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place and stress that wearing cloth masks [*covering both mouth and nose*] are an integral part of your social distancing efforts.  Model safe behaviors at all times and require the same of all those working in your organization.  Keep these measures in place until medical science supports a change in strategy. (see "Masks Help" section below)  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts. [*Without this, leaders cannot make informed-enough decisions about 'what next' and may result in decisions that negatively impact population health and mortality*.  *Testing and contact tracing is less expensive and more humane than hospitalizations.*]  
* Fund & then implement the purchase and formal coordination of PPE distribution to minimize waste and contention for limited resources.  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures.  
  * There are a broad range of financial issues that need your attention.  Many of them are fiendishly complex.  
    * One that is especially and increasingly time-critical is how to deal with increasing numbers of evictions - and the associated family and homelessness issues [https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/)  
* Use available resources to analyze your current state and plan.  For example the Covid-Local Metrics for Phased Reopening: [https://covid-local.org/metrics/](https://covid-local.org/metrics/), [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html#table1](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html#table1), and [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html#table2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html#table2)    
* Keep reviewing the state of COVID-19 related medical science, as well as your goals, tactics and strategies.  Maintaining available hospital capacity or meeting economic growth targets are not the most critical goals.  Maintaining public health is more important.  Human life has value -- keep that in focus at all times.  Using the words '*transparent*' or '*proactive*' are not the same as being transparent or proactive in your decision-making and actions.  Honesty, transparency, and being open to learning & change will earn you far more long lasting loyalty and compliance than any other behaviors.  
* Learn what executing a broad vaccination campaign means and requires.  
* Fund and implement comprehensive vaccination planning and implementation -- this includes formal coordination of vaccine distribution and its administration all the way through injection into humans (and re-injection, as needed).  This work requires consistent focus and strong managerial efforts across your sphere of responsibility and far beyond.  [Success is not guaranteed](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/).  Lean into this work and be a leader -- whatever your formal role.  As of May 8th, 2021, more than 40% of U.S. adults still have not received even one vaccine shot while states are asking the U.S. federal government to withhold large amounts of COVID-19 vaccine from their allotment each week.  Elected officials have a responsibility to help drive this vaccination campaign toward a more scientifically viable level (90-95%? vaccinated).  Do the same for vaccination campaigns outside the U.S. as well.  
* Remain humble.  Too many people for which you are responsible are getting sick.  Too many of them will die or will be haunted by life-altering after-effects of the disease.  Your decisions, your actions influence the impacts of the pandemic.  Engage in regular rigorous self-reflection, soul-searching, and self-appraisal.  Are you identifying the right investments?  Are you setting the right priorities?

***...as an employer***  
* Encourage your governmental leaders to prioritize getting vaccines into more people's arms sooner, and to expand those efforts globally.  *Nearly universal vaccination* is the only clear path to employee and customer safety.  Use all means available to get your employees and their families vaccinated.  For most of you, the health of your business and the broader economy depend upon it.  Support Federal vaccination mandates.  They work.  The Federal worker mandate resulted in over 90% of federal workers having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the Nov. 22, 2021 deadline.  If you have employees who are in regions where vaccination remains problematic, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible, and encourage & support healthy lifestyles.    
* Create and publicize a realistic strategy and accompanying plan for getting your employees vaccinated.  Incorporate into that plan the means to learn what is working and where challenges exist, and then immediately course-correct.  Set up a near-real-time dashboard to track employee vaccination injections to help hold yourself and your team accountable and to assist directing the right resources where they are needed (paraphrasing [a plea by Leana S. Wen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/29/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-slow-testing/).  *The unvaccinated* are a barrier to 'getting back to normal' -- or achieving any number of positive goals.  Turn up the pressure on unvaccinated members of your workforce -- they are a drag on your success.  
* Support work-from-home for as many roles as is possible, for as long as is practical.  
* Use the CDC "COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings" guidelines as an initial outline to structure your workplace preparation and operations. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html).  Emily Anthes wrote a useful article on "How to Reopen Offices Safely" at [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/health/coronavirus-reopening-office.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/health/coronavirus-reopening-office.html)  
* Spread of COVID-19 appears to be driven through airborne transmission of aerosols produced by asymptomatic individuals during breathing and speaking.  Coughing and droplets are dangerous, but aerosols can accumulate, remain infectious in indoor air for hours, and be easily inhaled deep into the lungs [[ref]](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1422).  Only specialized air-handling will effectively deal with these aerosols in the workplace.  ASHRAE has [actionable guidance](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources) on this topic.  Far-UVC light (207-222 nm) may may also play a role in safely inactivating airborne COVID-19[[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67211-2).  
* Learn what executing a broad vaccination campaign means and requires.  You may have a role.  [Success is not guaranteed](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/).  Help promote comprehensive participation in vaccination campaigns. Lean into this work and be a leader -- whatever your formal role.  Support the recent Federal vaccination mandates.  
* You are an individual and an official as well as an employer - use all the bullets above.  
* Focus on rapidly [increasing the pace](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends) of getting vaccines into people's arms.  For many of you, your business success, your revenue and profits depend upon it.  The health and welfare of your employees, customers, partners, service providers, suppliers, their businesses and the broader economy depend upon dramatically increasing the rate of vaccine delivery.  As of May 8th, 2021, more than 40% of U.S. adults still have not received even one vaccine shot while states are asking the U.S. federal government to withhold large amounts of COVID-19 vaccine from their allotment each week.  Employers have a responsibility to help drive this vaccination campaign toward a more economically sustainable level (90-95%? vaccinated).  Your employees will not be safe in any back-to-work setting until you do.  Support the same for vaccination campaigns outside the U.S. as well.

**Masks Help**  
"*Mask mandates save lives.*" by Niels-Jakob Hansen, Rui C. Mano, 09-01-2021 
[https://voxeu.org/article/mask-mandates-save-lives](https://voxeu.org/article/mask-mandates-save-lives)
Is mandating mask wearing effective in curbing the pandemic?  Hansen & Mano outline evidence that suggests it is effective and has saved tens of thousands of lives in the U.S.  Quote: "The emergence of new Covid-19 variants and a highly uneven vaccine rollout have put mask mandates back on the policy agenda. This column presents new evidence that state-level mask mandates reduced new weekly COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths significantly in the US. The results imply that 87,000 lives were saved up until 19 December 2020, while an additional 58,000 lives could have been saved if all states had put in place a mandate starting in April 2020. Mask mandates had a greater effect in counties more positively inclined towards mask wearing."

[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06067-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06067-8) (2020) and at [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.1007%2Fs11606-020-06067-8](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.1007%2Fs11606-020-06067-8)  
On 28 June 2021 the [New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/28/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-mask#worried-by-the-delta-variant-who-officials-urged-vaccinated-people-to-keep-wearing-masks) that "Dr. Mariângela Simão, the W.H.O.'s assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, emphasized at the briefing that *even vaccinated people should continue to consistently wear masks, avoid crowds and maintain social distance from others, make sure they are in well-ventilated spaces, wash hands frequently, and avoid sneezing or coughing around other people*.  "What we’re saying is, ‘*Once you’ve been fully vaccinated, continue to play it safe, because you could end up as part of a transmission chain.*’ You may not actually be fully protected," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the W.H.O.  He added, "I think the first message we want to be careful about is saying, ‘Once you’re vaccinated, you can just go ahead and do whatever.’"  
In late July 2021 the highly transmissible delta variant increased the necessity that we all consider employing properly worn N95s again.  N95s are better at resisting COVID-19 transmission than standard surgical masks because they are designed to fit snugly to the face.  Their design, materials and man allows them to filter at least 95 percent of airborne particulates -- which is a far higher rate than standard surgical or cloth home made masks.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has an [online guide](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/usernotices/counterfeitResp.html) with lists of N95 masks approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and tips for spotting counterfeit N95s.  If you can't get any of those [FDA-approved KN95s](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/revoked-euas-non-niosh-approved-disposable-filtering-facepiece-respirators) may be a useful replacement.

**Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness**  
You can read about treatement updates at: [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)  

Vaccine safety, relative to many other common activities, remains high and remains heavily supported by facts.  "One study tracked over 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states from April through mid-July. As delta surged in early summer, those who were unvaccinated were 4.5 times more likely than the fully vaccinated to get infected, over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm) - [quote from the Des Moines Register](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20210911&goTo=C004&artid=0)".  

[Brenda Goodman](https://www.webmd.com/brenda-goodman) reported that CDC data available in November 2021 [indicated](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20211110/how-covid-immunity-works) that at the peak of the Delta surge in August 2021, fully vaccinated people were 6 times less likely to get a COVID-19 infection compared to unvaccinated people, and were 11 times less likely to die if they were infected.  

The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program [https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html](https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html), has been in place since the 1980s to financially compensate people for serious adverse vaccine reactions[https://www.justice.gov/civil/vicp](https://www.justice.gov/civil/vicp).  Its activities have established a foundation of evidence about the frequency of vaccine-caused harm.  Between 2006 and 2018 in the U.S, there were 5,317 compensable concessions, court decisions, or settlements out of more than 3.7 billion vaccinations [https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/data-statistics-report.pdf](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/data-statistics-report.pdf). It works out to be about one compensable reaction per every 695,000 doses of any particular vaccine.  Most individuals living in the U.S. routinely participate in many activities that involve much worse odds than that.  
*The unvaccinated* are a barrier to 'getting back to normal' -- or achieving any number of positive goals.  COVID-19 vaccines that are approved for use in the U.S. are fantastically safe and effective at warding off serious illness and death.  Get vaccinated and make use of this medical miracle.  
The [CDC reported](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccine%20breakthrough%20infections,43%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories.) that as of April 13, 2021, more than 75 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 since December 14, 2020.  During the same time, CDC received 5,814 reports of vaccine breakthrough infections.  That is roughly 1 case in 12,900 vaccinations, or 0.0078% -- a remarkably low rate.  Around 30% of those breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, 7% required hospitalization (0.00054% of those fully vaccinated), and 1 percent of those breakthrough infected died (0.000077% of those fully vaccinated).  These vaccinations are far safer than numerous common activities that most of us engage in every day.  
As of May 8th, 2021, more than 40% of U.S. adults still have not received even one vaccine shot while states are asking the U.S. federal government to withhold large amounts of COVID-19 vaccine from their allotment each week.  All of us have a responsibility to help drive this vaccination campaign toward a more scientifically viable level (90-95%? vaccinated).  And to do the same for vaccination campaigns outside the U.S. as well.  
On April 13, 2021, [CDC and FDA recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/) a pause in the use of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) out of an abundance of caution while they review data involving a small number -- around 1 in a million -- of U.S. reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia (*'a weird clot'*) in individuals after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [met on April 14](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/janssen-faqs.html).  After hearing additional data on these reports, ACIP agreed that more information is needed before policy recommendations can be made regarding the continued use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.  The CDC  collected more information and convened another ACIP meeting on April 23 to review additional scientific evidence and [recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/JJUpdate.html) that use of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine resume in the United States, effective April 23, 2021.  This level of caution seems like good, evidence-enabled behavior and should support trust in the outcome.  
In June 2021, the [Food and Drug Administration added a warning](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-june-25-2021) about a rare but real risk of heart inflammation from myocarditis and pericarditis associated with the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines.  The additional fact sheet content references reports of adverse events suggesting increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly following the second dose, and with onset of symptoms within a few days after vaccination.  Additionally, they note that vaccine recipients should seek medical attention right away if they have chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart after vaccination.  
Use caution when you see or hear negative information about vaccines.  
One widespread concern has been the employment of 'emergency use authorization (EUA)' for COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S.  
In August 2021, [the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine). The vaccine has been known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (*the company will try to market it as Comirnaty (koe-mir’-na-tee)*).  It is approved for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older, and continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA), including for individuals 12 through 15 years of age and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals.  Detailed supporting documentation is available at: [https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine)  

In general, anti-vaccine myth-making seems highly concentrated.  Just [twelve anti-vaxxers are responsible for almost two-thirds of anti-vaccine content circulating on social media platforms](https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen).  Their disinformation and its reuse is a direct threat to public health.  Please ignore them and share that sentiment with those around you.  
See: "‘I’m sorry, but it’s too late’: Alabama doctor on treating unvaccinated, dying COVID patients." By Dennis Pillion, Jul 21, 2021. [https://www.al.com/news/2021/07/im-sorry-but-its-too-late-alabama-doctor-on-treating-unvaccinated-dying-covid-patients.html](https://www.al.com/news/2021/07/im-sorry-but-its-too-late-alabama-doctor-on-treating-unvaccinated-dying-covid-patients.html))  
Another thread of anti-vaccine sentiment is associated with anti-abortion efforts.  For decades, many vaccines use abortion-derived cell lines in design & development, production and/or confirm-atory lab testing.  Unfortunately, my informal survey of communications on this topic suggests that their quality, relevance, truthfulness appear to vary widely.  For those whose feelings about this topic drive resistance to COVID vaccines, I strongly recommend reading Richard K. Zimmerman's "[Helping patients with ethical concerns about COVID-19 vaccines in light of fetal cell lines used in some COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205255/)" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205255/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205255/) along with the fact-set at "Update: COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates and Abortion-Derived Cell Lines." by David Prentice, Ph.D.,  September 30, 2020 -- Updated June 2, 2021 [https://lozierinstitute.org/update-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-and-abortion-derived-cell-lines/](https://lozierinstitute.org/update-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-and-abortion-derived-cell-lines/) and [https://s27589.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/09.17.20-Fetal-Cell-Line-Fact-Sheet.pdf](https://s27589.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/09.17.20-Fetal-Cell-Line-Fact-Sheet.pdf)  

"Coronavirus vaccines work. But this statistical illusion makes people think they don’t." In Israel for a time, more vaccinated people were hospitalized for covid-19 than unvaccinated people. There’s no reason to worry. By Jordan Ellenberg [https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/08/31/covid-israel-hospitalization-rates-simpsons-paradox/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/08/31/covid-israel-hospitalization-rates-simpsons-paradox/)  

"Tens of millions of Americans have refused to get vaccinated, allowing the highly contagious delta variant to tear through the country and send the death toll from 600,000 (*in mid-June 2021*) to 700,000 in 3 1/ 2 months." [Quoted from DMR, by Tammy Webber and Heather Hollingsworth](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20211003&goTo=F001&artid=0)  

Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has analyzed publicly reported state data, said it’s safe to say at least 70,000 of the last 100,000 deaths were unvaccinated people. And of those vaccinated people who died with breakthrough infections, most caught the virus from an unvaccinated person, he said.  "If we had been more effective in our vaccination, then I think it’s fair to say, we could have prevented 90% of those deaths," since mid-June, Dowdy said.  "It’s not just a number on a screen," Dowdy said. "It’s tens of thousands of these tragic stories of people whose families have lost someone who means the world to them." [Quoted from DMR, by Tammy Webber and Heather Hollingsworth](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20211003&goTo=F001&artid=0)  

Get vaccinated.  Get boosted.

Maintain evidence of your vaccination status handy.  There are many options, from saving a photo of your card on your mobile device, to [one of the smart pass applications](https://www.commontrustnetwork.org/verifier-list).  If you lose track of your vaccination evidence, in most states you can get a copy of that evidence from your state's immunization information system (IIS).  The CDC maintains a list links to these of IIS sites: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state)  


**Treatments via Monoclonal Antibody Therapies or Anti-Viral Molnupiravir**  
First, get fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  Protect yourself and those around you -- and slow the cycle of infection that has imposed such a heavy cost on so many.  Treating active disease is no way out of this pandemic.  Getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is the only path to safety and to dampening the evolution of the virus that causes COVID-19.  After you are fully vaccinated, you are still at some risk of infection.  If you catch a break-through infection, monoclonal antibody therapies (infusions) and the newer Merk/Ridgeback Biotherapeutic molnupiravir pill may reduce your symptoms and speed recovery.  Merck has asked European Medicines Agency U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve molnupiravir, but neither have done so as of late October 2021.

**What About Those COVID-19 Variants?**  
Viruses mutate.  That is a key feature of their existence.  
You can see a visual of variant transmission over time at [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions).  Vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. currently protect against symptomatic infection and severe disease from all variants of the virus so far.  

Paul Griffin, Associate Professor, Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, The University of Queensland [recently wrote that](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/what-do-we-know-so-far-about-the-new-mu-covid-19-variant-and-how-can-we-prevent-further-mutations/): "There’s a high probability a new variant will arise one day that can significantly escape the protection offered by our vaccines, which are based on the original strain of the virus. We would call this an '*escape variant*'.  It’s hard to know if and when this would happen, but rampant community transmission of the virus increases the chances of such a variant emerging.  
Community health officials are echoing the same warnings.  For example [The Des Moines Register reported](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20211003&goTo=C001&artid=0) that Helen Eddy, director of the Polk county, Iowa health department, said that "the area’s hospitals have been packed, including with COVID-19 patients. The hospitals’ staff members are overworked and exhausted, she said, and they’re struggling to properly care for patients with a range of health issues."  "Eddy also raised concern that more dangerous variants will become more likely the longer the virus spreads among unvaccinated people."  "It is time for us to come together as a community and help each other by getting vaccinated," she said. "If we do not, we will be stuck in this cycle of new variants and surges. It is not sustainable."

In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic mutations impacting transmissibility and alignment with assumptions engineered into the currently available vaccines seem most important to understand (because misalignment may result in these vaccines being less effective).  Next to each variant below is its scientific name under the Pango system, from the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak group.  
* The *[Omicron variant (B.1.1.529)](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/coronavirus-variant-tracker.html?referringSource=articleShare)* was first detected in Botswana this in late November 2021 and was quickly identified in travellers to Israel from Malawi, Hong Kong from South Africa, and to Belgium from (travel itinerary unpublished).  On 26 November 2021, [the WHO declared 'Omicron' a 'Variant of Concern](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern),' and followed up on the 29th stating that "[The overall global risk related to the new VOC Omicron is assessed as very high.](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/enhancing-readiness-for-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-technical-brief-and-priority-actions-for-member-states)."  [Ewen Callaway reported in Nature that](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03552-w) this variant contains more than 30 changes to the spike protein. That protein is key to recognizing host cells and is largely what the body’s immune response targets.  [Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform, said](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/world/covid-variant-travel-restrictions.html) that the new variant has 10 mutations on the ACE2 receptor — the protein that helps to create an entry point for the coronavirus to infect human cells. In comparison, the Beta variant has three and the Delta variant two.  Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases specialist at the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform said that this variant shares similarities with the Lambda and Beta variants, which are associated with an innate evasion of immunity and which gives "us some concern that this variant might have not just enhanced transmissibility, so spread more efficiently, but might also be able to get around parts of the immune system and the protection we have in our immune system.”  Ewen Callaway also wrote that "Many of the changes have been found in variants such as Delta and Alpha and are linked to heightened infectivity and the ability to evade infection-blocking antibodies."  Research continues on transmissibility, its ability to evade the body's immune responses, and disease severity.  
[Janet Baseman, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington said](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/briefing/omicron-variant-need-to-know.html) that “The data out of South Africa suggest that the Omicron variant is spreading more quickly than Delta.”  As of early December 2021, [David Leonhardt reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/briefing/omicron-variant-need-to-know.html) that:  
  * There is little data about whether this is associated with transmissibility among those with no immunity, or an ability to evade immunity, or both.  [Dec. 7: Initial laboratory science reports material evation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/12/07/omicron-escape-antibodies/)  
  * There is little information about whether Omicron causes more severe disease than earlier variants.  
  * Vaccination appears to reduce the probability of Omicron infection causing severe disease.  The situation for unvaccinated people who have had a prior COVID-19 infection remains unclear.  
  * Existing COVID-19 testing appears effective at detecting the Omicron variant.  
* The *delta-plus variant (B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1)* was first detected in Europe (Mar. 2021), and has been detected in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, India, and South Korea.  The "plus" of the variant’s name refers to its K417N spike protein mutation, which was also found in some substrains of the alpha variant.  It appears to be more transmissible than other variants and some reports say it has the ability to bind more easily to lung cells and could be resistant to therapies used to treat the infection.  Others, for example the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium that increased transmissibility of the delta-plus variant is unlikely.  
* The *iota variant (B.1.526)* was first detected in New York, U.S.A. (Nov. 2020), and has spread to more than a dozen other U.S. states.  Some research has supported assumption that the iota variant is more contagious than the previously variants, and it may also be able to reinfect individuals who survived previous COVID-19 infections.  The vaccines authorized in the U.S. may be effective against severe disease and death from the iota variant, but as of July 2021 I was unable to find strong evidence or arguments to support that assertion.  
* The *delta variant (B.1.617)* was first detected in Maharashtra, India (Oct. 2020), and has been reported in dozens of countries.  In October of 2021 it remains the dominant strain in the U.S.  The delta variant is at least 50 percent more contagious than the previously-dominant alpha variant.  [Some research](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/health/coronavirus-aerosols-airborne.html) supports the idea that delta transmits more virus via aerosols, which helps make it more contagious.  The vaccines authorized in the U.S. are effective against severe disease and death from the delta variant and appear to provide some resistance to infection.  There is strong evidence that for a material, [yet still small](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/briefing/risk-breakthrough-infections-delta.html) number of the fully-vaccinated the delta variant [is breaking through their engineered immunity and resulting minor to moderate illness](https://www.nytimes.com/article/breakthrough-infections-covid-19-coronavirus.html).  In July and August 2021, this variant was driving up COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, suffering, and death across the U.S.  By early October 2021 U.S. infections and deaths began to trend down, but that trend does not exist in many regions having low vaccination rates.  Deaths and cases began trending up again in late November and into December 2021 with massive holiday travel and (*potentially relevant*) the addition of the Omicron variant.  
* The *beta variant (B.1.351 also called 501Y.V2)* was first detected in South Africa (Oct. 2020), and has been reported in over 120 countries.  Some research has supported assumption that the beta variant is more contagious than the previously-dominant alpha variant, and it also might be more resistant to monoclonal antibody therapies.  It also may be able to reinfect individuals who survived previous COVID-19 infections.  The vaccines authorized in the U.S. are are effective against severe disease and death from the beta variant and appear to provide some resistance to infection.  The Novavax and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have not shown strong resistance to the bega variant.  
* The *alpha variant (B.1.1.7 also called the "Kent" variant)* was first detected in the United Kingdom (Sep. 2020), and has been reported in dozens of countries.  The alpha variant is about 50 percent more contagious than the common strain and may be 30 to 70 percent more lethal.  The vaccines authorized in the U.S. are effective against the alpha variant.  
* The *[gamma variant](https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/93415) (P. 1)* was first detected in Brazil (July 2020), and has been reported in dozens of countries and dozens of U.S. states.  In early July of 2021 is the dominant strain in the U.S.  Some research has supported assumption that the gamma variant is more contagious than the previous variants, and it also might be more resistant to antibody therapies.  It also may be able to reinfect individuals who survived previous COVID-19 infections.  The vaccines authorized in the U.S. are effective against severe disease and death from the gamma variant and appear to provide some resistance to infection.  
* The *G variant (D614G)* was first detected in China (Jan. 2020), and has been reported across Earth.  Some research has supported assumption that the G variant is more contagious than the original virus.  The vaccines authorized in the U.S. are effective against severe disease and death from the G variant and appear to provide some material resistance to infection.  
* The *Eeek mutation (E484K)* is described as a mutation within a variant, and has been seen in subsets of the beta, gamma and alpha variants.  The Eeek mutation may help the virus evade human immune system adaptations prompted by the major vaccines.  Vaccines authorized in the U.S. appear to be effective against severe disease and death from the variants carrying the Eeek mutation and appear to provide some resistance to infection.  Variants carrying the Eeek mutation also may be able to reinfect individuals who survived previous COVID-19 infections.  
* The *Denmark/California mutation (L452R)* is described as a mutation within a variant, and has been seen in subsets of the beta, gamma and alpha variants.  It was first discovered in Denmark (Mar. 2020).  It was widely circulating in California in Spring 2021 and public-health officials there declared the variant with this mutation a "variant of concern".  There is some evidence that variants having the Denmark/California mutation are more contagious and that it may help the virus evade human immune system adaptations prompted by the major vaccines.  The effectiveness of vaccines authorized in the U.S. against given variants incorporating the Denmark/California mutation remains uncertain.  
* The *Lambda variant (C.37)* was first discovered in Peru and is found largely in Peru, Chile, USA Germany, Mexico and Ecuador.  It is a [WHO variant of interest](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).  
* The *Mu variant (B.1.621)* was first discovered in Columbia (Jan. 2021). The strain has been [detected in at least 42 countries and 49 U.S. states](https://outbreak.info/situation-reports?pango=B.1.621).  It is a [WHO variant of interest](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).  The Mu variant has increased spread in "[a relatively short time in some cities that were near the theoretical herd immunity](https://outbreak.info/resources/pmid34403832)" suggesting it can bypass some of the resistance provided by natural infection and vaccines and has the potential for an epidemiologic impact.  It has been unable, though, to push out the Delta variant.  Most of what is known about the Mu variant's characteristics and its capabilities to evade protections provided by vaccines has been the result of lab work.  That leaves [some uncertainty about how it will behave in the *real world.*](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/what-do-we-know-so-far-about-the-new-mu-covid-19-variant-and-how-can-we-prevent-further-mutations/)  

This section is largely a summary of work by Marisa Iati and Angela Fritz in: "What you need to know about the coronavirus variants." By Marisa Iati and Angela Fritz (accessed 2021-07-18) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2021/01/25/covid-variants/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2021/01/25/covid-variants/), with some factoids from "The Beta Variant: What Scientists Know" By Emily Anthes, 2021-07-19 [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/health/beta-variant-covid-19.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/health/beta-variant-covid-19.html), and "Here’s what we know about the delta-plus variant." By Jennifer Hassan and Lateshia Beachum, 2021-08-03. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/03/delta-plus-coronavirus-variant-explained/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/03/delta-plus-coronavirus-variant-explained/).  See the whole variant list at [https://cov-lineages.org/lineage_list.html](https://cov-lineages.org/lineage_list.html)   

**COVID-19 Fatality Rate**  
COVID-19 is far more lethal than seasonal flu. About [1.7% of *diagnosed* coronavirus cases are lethal](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality), compared with 0.1% of diagnosed flu cases.  Scientists argue that the number of people infected is far higher than the number who receive an official diagnoses which results in a lower death rates.  In that context, the CDC estimates that the U.S. COVID-19 death rate is around 0.65% -- compared to flu’s 0.025% fatality rate.  Because the U.S. maintains high rates of infection, that 0.65% fatality rate has produced at least [784,893 deaths](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totaldeaths) (2021 Dec 5) in the U.S. alone (with at least 5 million world-wide).  Differences in the rates of infection throughout given populations results in widely varying ["deaths/100,000" rates](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#global-counts-rates) -- highlighting *the importance of managing risks*.  

**Herd Immunity**  
Herd immunity is about reaching vaccination thresholds needed to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission.  
There is still uncertainty, but most scientists use high percentages - 75% to, more recently, 90% or higher fully vaccinated.  
Unfortunately, largely anti-intellectual hostility to vaccines plus political hostility to COVID-19 vaccination appear to remove herd immunity as a practical goal for the U.S.  As of late November 2021, 136,868 doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been injected per 100,000 persons in the U.S.  For comparison, that rate (or coverage) is not very high.  On November 23, 2021 it was lower than 48 other countries [listed in order of coverage from highest down]: Cuba, United Arab Emirates, Malta, Chile, Uruguay, Palau, Israel, Iceland, Seychelles, China, Singapore, Qatar, Cambodia, Bahrain, Brunei, United Kingdom, Korea, South, Ireland, Malaysia, Spain, Portugal, Canada, France, Belgium, Italy, Japan, Norway, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden, Australia, Mongolia, Finland, Bhutan, San Marino, Austria, Mauritius, Argentina, Netherlands, Turkey, Germany, Maldives, Hungary, Luxembourg, El Salvador, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, and Panama.  

Polls have found that ~10% of self-identified Democrats and more than 40% of Republicans are unlikely to participate in COVID-19 vaccination.  One in five Americans continue to say they’re "not at all likely to get the vaccine," a figure that has barely budged since the beginning of 2021, according to an Axios-Ipsos poll in April 2021 and supported by an [AP-NORC poll in July 2021](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-science-health-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-36ea18ee3a3397da7edd5b8249f0e477).  
Current scientific understanding projects that in areas where vaccinations are low, COVID-19 virus will continue to thrive and mutate, increasing the probability of harm in those areas and beyond (we remain one earth).  
Even in that pessimistic outlook, the broader the pools of immunity we achieve, the better off we'll all be.  Learn about the fantastic successes of currently-available vaccines -- and get vaccinated as soon as is practical for you.  

**Resist Participating in Efforts to Use COVID-19 Health Measures into Wedge Issues**  
Birthing or nurturing COVID-19 health measures into wedge issues is harmful for all of us.  It harms our health as well as societal cohesion, and it is used by some to weaken democracy.  Resist these ideas and communications -- it will make you (and the rest of us) safer and healthier.  
Don't initiate or participate in attempts to divide people or groups on wearing masks.  This has led to physical confrontations, attacks, and arrests.  See "Masks Help" above.  
Don't initiate or participate in attempts to divide people or groups on being vaccinated.  Approved COVID-19 vaccinations are highly safe and effective.  They involve far less risk of injury or death than many, many common activities.  See "Vaccine Safety" above.  

Don't initiate or participate in attempts to divide people or groups on so-called "vaccine passports."  Businesses, all levels of government, and private organizations are all struggling with policies and practices that will help them "open up" as COVID-19 risks recede.  One thread of that activity involves evidence of immunization against COVID-19.  Vaccination-status is part of a broader category of private health-related information, but no serious efforts to deal with *opening up* involve exposing all personal health information to routine verification.  If you have strong feelings on this topic, help figure it out -- it is an important issue that could benefit from diverse inputs.  

Unfortunately, this will require effort for many of you because too many senior leaders in local, state and federal government insist on framing COVID-19 as a campaign issue -- where '*campaign*' is code for creating battles about '*us*' versus '*them*.'  For example, in my home state, Iowa, [our Governor](https://governor.iowa.gov/about-the-governor) and her [Medical Director of the Iowa Department of Public Health/State Epidemiologist](https://idph.iowa.gov/medical-director) use the language and [behaviors](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20210727&goTo=C001&artid=0) of political campaigning when referencing COVID-19.  They have, and continue to [eliminate access](https://www.testiowa.com/en/) to [and obfuscate](https://public.domo.com/embed/pages/31wVn) [data](https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/) about the state of COVID-19 infection/transmission and resulting impacts, while speaking about vaccinations, masking, and other COVID-19 transmission reducers as if they were '*against our freedoms*,' '*just another personal choice*' like 'eggs' versus 'cereal' for breakfast and as actions that inhibit their plans for '*getting the state and back to school, back to work, and back to all locations where people spend money and generate cash-flow*.'  The Governor's [July 27th press conference](https://governor.iowa.gov/press-release/reynolds-statement-on-new-covid-19-guidance-from-the-biden-administration%C2%A0%C2%A0) was a classic example of her using COVID-19 as a wedge topic.  In late October 2021 the Iowa Governor continued to '*wedge*,' [joining a lawsuit against the Biden administration](https://governor.iowa.gov/press-release/state-of-iowa%C2%A0joins-lawsuit%C2%A0challenging-vaccine-mandates-for%C2%A0workers-employed-by-a) over its vaccine requirement for employees in conjunction with signing [a law](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&ba=hf902) granting unemployment benefits to anyone fired for refusing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 -- saying that "[no one should be forced to choose between making a living or standing up for their personal beliefs](https://governor.iowa.gov/press-release/governor-reynolds-signs%C2%A0bipartisan%C2%A0vaccine-mandate%C2%A0bill-into-law%C2%A0%C2%A0)" and promising that "We will be taking other legal actions against the Biden Administration’s vaccine mandate."  [also, for some context see: [link](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20211030&goTo=A001&artid=0)]  This behavior should be examined in the context of her years of attacking and constraining the availability of unemployment benefits (and by implications, those who receive them) along with the thousands of ['*excess deaths from CIVID-19*'](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) her leadership helps to deliver.  

After more than 18 months of this pandemic around 1 of every 545 Americans have been killed by COVID-19 and too many political *leaders* (including the [Iowa Governor](https://governor.iowa.gov/about-the-governor)) continue to promote a vague call for some version of '*individual liberty*' over the common good.  In [Sept. 2021, the Des Moines Register reported](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20210907&goTo=A001&artid=1) that, contradicting CDC guidance, Iowa prohibits mask requirements in schools while the "current guidance from Iowa’s health department says COVID-19 should be treated like any other childhood illness, such as strep throat or pink eye. That means students who test positive or show certain symptoms should not go to school," but (in Iowa) that contact tracing is unneeded, and that quarantine after exposure is an individual decision for individuals (and for school children, their parents) -- maximizing risks of infection, suffering, hospitalizations, and death, as well as the evolution of new and potentially vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants.  Where there is potentially useful information coming from the state, for example a ['Find a Provider' site ](https://vaccinate.iowa.gov/providers/) implementation is largely passive -- 'enabling' others to do COVID-19 mitigation work.  The fruits of these leadership behaviors are a population that is largely mask-free while being somewhere [between 55% and 60% fully vaccinated](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-fully-percent-total) -- which [seems highly unsafe and unsustainable](https://healthdata.gov/Community/COVID-19-State-Profile-Report-Iowa/enjr-ewxm).  Iowa COVID-19 deaths since March 2020 are at least 1 in every 424 residents (3.155 million / 7,445 on 05 Dec 2021), a materially higher rate than for the broader U.S.  For reference, 7,445 COVID deaths would empty more than two average sized Iowa towns (currently available U.S. Census data show the average town population in Iowa is less than 3,300).

* Back in 2006, 90 percent of epidemiologists were predicting a major pandemic within two generations [https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_brilliant_my_wish_help_me_stop_pandemics/transcript?language=en](https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_brilliant_my_wish_help_me_stop_pandemics/transcript?language=en). 
* In early January 2020 the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, in collaboration with the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control, and the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia released a coronavirus genome from a case of a respiratory disease from the Wuhan outbreak (Jan 6th or 10th) [http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319](http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319) and scientists began studying it for opportunities almost immediately, for example: [https://twitter.com/k_stephensonMD/status/1348459874196320257/](https://twitter.com/k_stephensonMD/status/1348459874196320257/)  
* Over the past 20 years, three coronaviruses have caused severe respiratory disease in humans: Covid-19, SARS and MERS.  Each of these coronaviruses jumped to humans from bats or other mammals.  There are four other coronaviruses that infect people --usually causing only mild colds.  The most recent, HCoV-HKU1, began infecting humans in the 1950s.  Another, HCoV-NL63, may have started infecting humans more than 800 years ago.

* This is not the first pandemic of this nature.  There were quite a few others in addition to the well-known 1918-1919 Flu pandemic.  See "The Flu -- A brief history of influenza in U.S. America, Europe, Hawaii." By A. Mouritz, 1921, hosted on [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61607/61607-h/61607-h.htm](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61607/61607-h/61607-h.htm)  
   Quote: "MAIN FACTOR OF SPREAD. Not the Weather, but HUMAN intercourse, especially Commerce; the greater the speed of Commerce, the greater and quicker is the spread of the Flu; it follows the path of HUMAN travel; it is a Contagion solely spread by HUMAN intercourse, viz. 'The Influenza Carrier or Carriers.'  
   Positions in life, which require contact with Travelers, necessarily influence and spread the disease.  
   'Flu' is spread in the same ratio of speed as the Carrier of IT.  
   When the Flu is a weakling, his best Nurses and Foster-Mothers are Overcrowding and lack of Pure Air.  
   Where the Crowd is, there the Flu is: little crowding means little Flu; plenty of Crowding, plenty of Flu."
