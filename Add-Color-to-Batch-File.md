# Using Color In Batch/CMD files  

I still use batch/cmd files to help myself and others speed up repetitive tasks on Windows endpoints.  Yes, I understand that PowerShell, Python, and more exist, but I can code up many simple tasks with a batch file much faster than with other languages.  If there is an important driver for one of those more powerfull languages, I use them, but economy drives to batch for a range of repetitive activities.  

There are use cases where employing color can help users better understand any given utility's output.  

### Batch file for seeing how given codes will look on your endpoing.  
```batch
@ECHO OFF
