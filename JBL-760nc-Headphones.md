## JBL 760NC HEADPHONES NOT TURNING OFF  
https://www.reddit.com/r/JBL/comments/r1z546/jbl_760nc_headphones_not_turning_off/  
Hi, my JBL 760nc headphones that are just under 2 weeks old aren't responding when I press the buttons. The power button isn't working and neither is the noise-cancelling one. They are permanently turned on and I can't seem to connect them to any device either. Any suggestions on what I should do? I am going to try to let the battery drain out, I don't have much choice because they can't turn off, hopefully, that fixes the problem.  

ANSWER: If you plug the charger in it should automatically turn off.  

That worked.  



## JBL wireless headphones stuck on white light and don’t turn off.

If your JBL Bluetooth headphones gone stuck on white light, unresponsive and you’re unable to even turn it off try following solutions. It worked on my pair of JBL Live 500 BT.  

•Solution 1:  

    Factory reset (press and hold both volume buttons + and - together for 5 seconds)  

•Solution 2:  

    Press or slide (depending on your headphones model) power button 3 times.  

•Solution 3:  

    Press and hold the power button for one minute.  

If none of the solutions above worked and the white light is still on and your headphones are still unresponsive try solution 4 which helped my copletely stuck on white light JBL Live 500BT.  

•Solution 4  

    Plug your headphones to a laptop via usb cable. White light should turn off automatically. Press power button on again and the headphones should return to normal.  

I hope one of these solutions will bring your stuck on white light JBL wireless headphones back on working properly.  


## JBL Tune 760NC not charging  

I bought my JBL Tunes about a year and a half ago, before going to Uni. They were my love, my life and I used them all the time. I took very good care of them and made sure ro only use the included cable.  

Suddenly, they stopped charging properly. The charging light would light up for a bit and then turn off and stop charging, despite the headphones being empty. Nothing works. I reset them - nothing. What do I do? I really want to keep using these headphones.  

ANSWER: I have the same issue with the same model. So far figured out they charge ok from usb 3.0 (specifically) port of my laptop, but I have to replug them around 2-3 times, after that the red light stops turning off and they charge normally. Used them for barely half a year.
