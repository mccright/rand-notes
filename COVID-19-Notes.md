## Focus on Facts and Restrict the Flow of Misinformation
------------------------------------------------------
In general terms, COVID-19 monitoring/testing has much lower priority across the U.S. than in 2020-2022.  Reductions in monitoring can dramatically mask the scope of disease impacts.  For example, Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center / Howard Hughes Medical Institute [reported in July 2023](https://bedford.io/talks/sars-cov-2-evolutionary-forecasting-nwpgcoe/#/17) that "roughly 1 in 3 (COVID-19) infections were detected in 2021, while only 1 in 40 in 2023..." and that a material burden imposed by COVID-19 disease remains endemic -- [reporting that](https://bedford.io/talks/sars-cov-2-evolutionary-dynamics-asv/#/42) the "U.S. has seen 40,000 COVID-19 deaths from Jan 1 to Jun 10," 2023.  

```
Action on COVID-19 at home and abroad is **still** urgently needed to save lives.  
Get vaccinated.  Help your family and friends do the same.  
Get boosted.  Help your family and friends do the same.  
Ventilate shared spaces.  
Avoid crowds.  
Don't hesitate to use masks in crowded enclosed places.  
Test if you have symptoms.  
Isolate if you are positive or cannot access a test.  
Use masks if you are ill.  
Support global vaccine distribution.  Pockets of unvaccinated, regardless of their location, are reservoirs for the virus, where it replicates and mutates, and where new variants evolve.  Vaccinations reduce human suffering both locally and globally.

*[in July 2022 CDC officials said between 26 million and 37 million adults in the U.S. haven't had a single COVID-19 vaccine dose](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20220721&goTo=A002&artid=0)*  

By October 2022 the Covid pandemic had killed nearly as many Americans as [U.S. troops died in battle during all of our wars combined](https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/fs_americas_wars.pdf). (*This is a near-quote from Dr. Craig Spencer at [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/opinion/covid-ebola-pandemic-prevention.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/opinion/covid-ebola-pandemic-prevention.html)*)  

[230,637,348 people in the U.S. are considered fully vaccinated](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states) with the original COVID-19 vaccine.  That is 70% of the [333.29 million people in the U.S. in 2022](https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/).  [Only 63.5% of Iowans reach that fully vaccinated](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states) status, and only [35.4% of Iowans have received a *booster* or additional dose](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states).  Gov. Kim Reynolds rejects *most* science-based pandemic mitigation strategies in Iowa, [vowing in an August 2023 statement: “Not on my watch.”](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20231023&goTo=A001&artid=1&editionStart=Des%20Moines%20Register)  Her approach to pandemic response has fueled broader anti-vaccine skepticism.  [Requests for the new CO-VID 19 vaccines are at all-time lows, and federal health data shows vaccination rates among U.S. kindergartners for diseases such as measles and polio have declined over the past two years.](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20231023&goTo=A001&artid=1&editionStart=Des%20Moines%20Register)

>According to a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in September 2022, rates of excess deaths were 76 percent higher among Republicans than Democrats throughout the pandemic. The gap was much smaller in 2020; it then grew almost sevenfold with the arrival of vaccines. [David Wallace-Wells, NYT. April 24, 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/24/magazine/dr-fauci-pandemic.html)  

And the KFF reports that there remains [dramatic differences in the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines between Democrats and Republicans](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2023/) through September 2023. With an additional view of that data [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n6enw/2/#).  

COVID-19 strains continue to circulate widely. The [KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor (January 17-24, 2023) reported](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-january-2023/) that nearly four in ten say that they or someone in their household were sick with either COVID-19, RSV, or flu over the past month.
