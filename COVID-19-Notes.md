## Focus on Facts and Restrict the Flow of Misinformation
------------------------------------------------------
In general terms, COVID-19 monitoring/testing has much lower priority across the U.S. than in 2020-2022.  Reductions in monitoring can dramatically mask the scope of disease impacts.  For example, Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center / Howard Hughes Medical Institute [reported in July 2023](https://bedford.io/talks/sars-cov-2-evolutionary-forecasting-nwpgcoe/#/17) that "roughly 1 in 3 (COVID-19) infections were detected in 2021, while only 1 in 40 in 2023..." and that a material burden imposed by COVID-19 disease remains endemic -- [reporting that](https://bedford.io/talks/sars-cov-2-evolutionary-dynamics-asv/#/42) the "U.S. has seen 40,000 COVID-19 deaths from Jan 1 to Jun 10," 2023.  

```
Action on COVID-19 at home and abroad is **still** needed to save lives.  
Get vaccinated.  Help your family and friends do the same.  
Get boosted.  Help your family and friends do the same.  
Ventilate shared spaces.  
Avoid crowds.  
Don't hesitate to use masks in crowded enclosed places.  
Test if you have symptoms.  
Isolate if you are positive or cannot access a test until you have not had a fever for 24 hours (the same recommendation for the flu and other respiratory illnesses).  
Use masks if you are ill.  
Support global vaccine distribution.  Pockets of unvaccinated, regardless of their location, are reservoirs for the virus, where it most effectively replicates and mutates, and where new variants evolve.  Vaccinations reduce human suffering both locally and globally.

[Dr. Daniela J. Lamas](https://postgraduateeducation.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/daniela-lamas), a pulmonary and critical-care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston [reports that](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/10/opinion/covid-endemic-fear.html):  
>"Nearly four years after the World Health Organization’s declaration of a pandemic, the coronavirus is still with us. It likely always will be. And it is still resulting in [500 to 1,500 deaths every week](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00) as of the last month — higher than the mortality from influenza, though lower compared to previous years. There is also the persistent threat of [long Covid](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/opinion/long-covid-research-funding.html, the debilitating symptoms that can persist after an initial infection."  

*[in July 2022 CDC officials said between 26 million and 37 million adults in the U.S. haven't had a single COVID-19 vaccine dose](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20220721&goTo=A002&artid=0)*  

By October 2022 the Covid pandemic had killed nearly as many Americans as [U.S. troops died in battle during all of our wars combined](https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/fs_americas_wars.pdf). (*This is a near-quote from [Dr. Craig Spencer in the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/opinion/covid-ebola-pandemic-prevention.html)*)  

[230,637,348 people in the U.S. are considered fully vaccinated](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states) with the original COVID-19 vaccine.  That is 70% of the [333.29 million people in the U.S. in 2022](https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/).  [Only 63.5% of Iowans reached that fully vaccinated](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states) status, and only [35.4% of Iowans have received a *booster* or additional dose](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states).  Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds rejects *most* science-based pandemic mitigation strategies [vowing in an August 2023 statement: “Not on my watch.”](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20231023&goTo=A001&artid=1&editionStart=Des%20Moines%20Register)  Her approach to pandemic response has helped fuel broader anti-vaccine skepticism.  [Requests for the new COVID 19 vaccines are at all-time lows, and federal health data shows vaccination rates among U.S. kindergartners for diseases such as measles and polio have declined over the past two years](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20231023&goTo=A001&artid=1&editionStart=Des%20Moines%20Register). In late December 2023 [Michaela Ramm and Samantha Hernandez reported](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2023/12/21/covid-flu-hit-des-moines-polk-county-schools-ahead-of-winter-break-student-absences-illness-rsv/71971410007/) in the Des Moines Register that:  
>Just 2.9% of children in Iowa between the ages of 6 months and 17 years have an updated COVID-19 shot as of Dec. 2, according to the the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, 27.8% of adults age 18 and older in Iowa have received the new vaccine. In Polk County, just 12.4% of residents are up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations, the county health department says. As of Monday, 30% of the state’s population have received a flu shot, according to state data. Twenty- six percent of Polk County residents have received the latest flu shot so far this year, a drop from the roughly 40% average flu shot rate among county residents over the past 6 years, local health officials say.  
By late April 2024 [Michaela Ramm reported](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2024/04/22/blank-childrens-hospital-respiratory-illness-rise-rsv-influenza-bronchitis-family-health/73375649007/) in the Des Moines Register that:  
>Iowa is far below the recommended vaccination rate. As of last week, only about 15% of the state’s population were fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and about 34% of all Iowans had received a flu shot.  
 
It is possible that Reynolds' approach to this topic also plays a role in her state's increasing death rate.  In 2022, the [age-adjusted death rate in the US was 833.6 deaths per 100,000 people for the Nation and slightly higher 836.7 per 100,000 people for Iowa](https://usafacts.org/topics/health/#349155c5-6865-42e8-a777-b2291a4680e5).  Nation-wide, [that is 13.8% higher than in 2012](https://usafacts.org/topics/health/#349155c5-6865-42e8-a777-b2291a4680e5), a decade before. Compare that with states like New York at 685.3 or New Jersey at 708.6 or nearby Minnesota at 750.3. Another way to look at increasing Iowan deaths during the COVID-19 crisis is to simply look at the graphs of deaths 2019-2024 on the state's new "[Health Statistics](https://hhs.iowa.gov/public-health/health-statistics)" page under the heading "Death" and notice the material increase in the number of deaths in the fall-winter 2020-2021 and again in 2021-2022 -- given the relatively consistent pattern of other years, these *excess* deaths seem reasonably attributable to COVID-19 and its downstream effects -- especially when you see the [very low COVID-19 immunization rates across Iowa](https://data.idph.state.ia.us/t/IDPH-DataViz/views/COVID-19VaccineImmunization/COVID-19Vaccine?%3Aembed=y&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y). The impacts of Gov. Reynolds' pandemic *leadership* and that of her political peers are not evenly distributed throughout the U.S. population.  

>According to a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in September 2022, rates of excess deaths were 76 percent higher among Republicans than Democrats throughout the pandemic. The gap was much smaller in 2020; it then grew almost sevenfold with the arrival of vaccines. [David Wallace-Wells, NYT. April 24, 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/24/magazine/dr-fauci-pandemic.html)  

An [authoratative study published in The Lancet, April 2023](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00461-0/fulltext), reported that "our results show that states where a greater fraction of the population voted for the Republican Party's 2020 presidential candidate, on average, had more infections and more total COVID-19 deaths (*per 100,000*) for the entire study period. Those findings are consistent with other studies."  The authors found that higher education appears to be a material antidote to materially negative partisan healthcare behaviors: "An important exception emerged in our results: we found an association between strong health systems and vaccine coverage in Republican-leaning states with higher mean years of education](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00461-0/fulltext#back-bib74).  

Although these facts have been covered widely in the news and on social media.  They appear to have little to no impact on well documented partisan healthcare behaviors, along with related impacts.  

The KFF reports that there remains [dramatic differences in the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines between Democrats and Republicans](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2023/) through September 2023. With an additional view of that data [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n6enw/2/#).  

COVID-19 strains continue to circulate widely. The [KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor (January 17-24, 2023) reported](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-january-2023/) that nearly four in ten say that they or someone in their household were sick with either COVID-19, RSV, or flu over the past month.

>"Wastewater surveillance offers a potential solution to the problem of accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance because it is agnostic to symptomatic, diagnosed, or reported disease. High-resolution sequencing of wastewater can also identify emerging variants of concern4 and estimate the effective reproductive number,5 a key predictor of future transmission."

>"WBE-based (wastewater-based epidemiology) models accurately predicted the county-level weekly new admissions, allowing a preparation window of 1-4 weeks. In real applications, periodically updated WBE-based models showed good accuracy and transferability, with mean absolute error within 4-6 patients/100k population for upcoming weekly new hospitalization numbers. Our study demonstrated the potential of using WBE as an effective method to provide early warnings for healthcare systems."

### Notable Historical Facts:  
* COVAX delivered nearly 2 billion doses of vaccines to 146 economies, averting an estimated 2.7 million excess deaths in lower-income participating economies will close 31 December 2023. See the full story at [https://www.unicef.org...](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covid-19-vaccinations-shift-regular-immunisation-covax-draws-close). Quote:  
>COVAX, the multilateral mechanism for equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines launched in 2020, will draw to a close on 31 December. Jointly led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), COVAX has so far supplied nearly 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses and safe injection devices to 146 economies. Its efforts are estimated to have helped avert the deaths of at least 2.7 million people in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) low- and lower middle-income participating economies (lower-income economies) that received free doses through the mechanism, alongside nearly US$ 2 billion in critical support to turn vaccines into vaccinations.
