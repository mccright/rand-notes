## Attempts to Demonize and Silence Critics of Trumpism Ignore Facts About Violence & Terrorism in U.S.  

In recent decades, right-wing extremism has resulted in materially greater levels of violence and death than left-wing extremism.  
>[Since 2015, right-wing extremists have been involved in 267 plots or attacks and 91 fatalities, the data shows. At the same time, attacks and plots ascribed to far-left views accounted for 66 incidents leading to 19 deaths](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/).  

Influencers on the right regularly attempt to keep the public from believing facts about right-wing violence -- typically repetitively targeting information about violent incidents with a mix of conspiracy theories and bald lies in their efforts to deflect attention, provoke distrust in the media broadly and more specifically in individuals outside their tribe that were the victim of (*or adjacent to*) that right-wing violence.  A common approach is to characterize victims of right-wing violence as "the real wrongdoers."  Take the example of David DePape's physical attack on Paul Pelosi in a failed attempt to harm Senator Nancy Pelosi (*2022-10-28*) -- [a broad spectrum of right-wing influencers quickly spread lies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/30/paul-pelosi-attack-misinformation-elon-musk/) that [attempted to deflect attention away from facts describing the attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Paul_Pelosi#Misinformation_and_disinformation), the attacker and his published views & *confession*, to sell the idea that this was not real and/or it was cooked up by the Left.  [Some examples included](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/pelosi-attack-misinformation-conspiracy-republicans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare), *but were not limited to*, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Dinesh D’Souza, Roger Stone, Stephen K. Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Garrett Ziegler, Donald Trump Jr., David Clarke Jr., Charlie Kirk, AZ Republican state senator Wendy Rogers, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Representative Clay Higgins, Representative Claudia Tenney, each claiming (*or pointing to claims*) that the attack on Mr. Pelosi was really a lie, a false flag, and/or a treasonous act/plot by Speaker Pelosi...  In an overt effort to *free up* this type of disinformation and hate speech, [Elon Musk has dismantled most of the relevant controls at Twitter and boosted reach of some users generating and/or promoting hate speech](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/14/twitter-moderation-cutbacks-impact/) (*in violation of Twitter's policies*).

Trump and Trumpists repetitively blame -- with a mix of outrage and fear -- Democratic candidates, the Democratic party, [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter), *[antifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_(United_States))*, (*the 'radical left' in general*), *libs*, Jews and non-white immigrants/migrants (*characterizing them as 'criminals,' but emphasing 'them' as bad*) for economic and broader societal problems.  To aid Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, [this was carried out at scale](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/cambridge-analyticas-parent-pleads-guilty-to-breaking-uk-data-law/) using online human intelligence techniques used in [psychological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare) coupled with [psychological profiling](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/psychological-profiling) using illegally obtained social media data by [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica).  Leading up to and after the November 2020 elections, they helped birth and amplified what they called *a vast conspiracy resulting in corruption of the popular vote* adding outrage at and fear of the democratic process and democracy itself.  Too many of them appear to [see politics as blood sport and use violent rhetoric to mobilize their heavily armed base](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/03/threats-violence-members-congress-intimidation/) and more recently, [to intimidate and discipline others in their own party](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/opinion/trump-political-violence.html), as well as outsiders.  There is [increasing evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/us/politics/trump-right-wing-domestic-terrorism.html) that this program of misinformation was also pushed into the management ranks of U.S. justice and intelligence services so that it became a systemic force to de-emphasize far right threats in favor of *finding* and *attacking* often-exaggerated threats from the left and from non-whites.  In a representative example of how Trump's election denialism has stoked rising right-wing political violence in the US, [Nicole Narea reports on Solomon Peña, a Republican candidate who lost his race for New Mexico House District 14 against incumbent Democrat Miguel Garcia by more than 47%](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/1/18/23561196/solomon-pena-shooting-new-mexico-conspiracy-election), was arrested in mid-January 2023 for leading a conspiracy to shoot at four Democratic officials' homes after refusing to accept his November election loss.  He engaged multiple people over several weeks and stole at least 2 vehicles in his shooting attacks on Democrats.   
By early spring 2023, Trump chose Waco, Texas (*heavy with meaning for the Far Right -- many of whom see the state as a violent enemy of the people*) as his stage for [dehumanizing (*degenerate psychopath*)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/us/politics/trump-bragg-indictment-protests.html) and [alluding to violence (*potential death & destruction*)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/24/trump-hush-money-death-destruction/) against those involved in State and Federal grand jury inquiries into potential criminal activity associated with the former president's behavior, all while [casting himself as a victim of the “weaponization” of the justice system](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/25/us/politics/trump-waco-texas-speech.html).  

Concurrently, a material subset of the white evangelical demographic in America continues convulsing White grievance and increasingly violent rhetoric about attacks on (*their*) America.  [Race and/or religious identity seem central to their motivations](https://religiondispatches.org/how-far-will-white-christians-go-to-maintain-power-an-interview-with-robert-jones/).  Also see podcaster Joe Oltmann, who sells [his daily vision of America's dark and violent future](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/27/with-violent-rhetoric-election-denial-podcaster-becomes-gop-force/).  
>"Pretty soon we'll have gallows being built all over the country. We can take care of all these traitors to our nation," he told listeners during an episode late last year. ... "If you're going to take our way of life away from us, you're not going to do it without blood spilled."  

[Ronald Brownstein summarized](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/23/politics/race-immigration-replacement-theory-demographics/index.html) the role of "*replacement theory*" in this mix:  
>"Far right White supremacist groups, conservative media personalities and now Republicans in Congress are trying to inflame nativist feelings among conservative Whites by warning that liberals want immigrants to "replace" native-born Americans in the nation's culture and electorate."    

A recent [poll by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI)](https://www.prri.org/research/creating-more-inclusive-public-spaces-structural-racism-confederate-memorials-and-building-for-the-future/) recently used answers to eleven questions to quantify a "structural racism index."  Evidence suggests that the index provides a reliable read on a given [person’s attitudes on "white supremacy and racial inequality, the impact of discrimination on African American economic mobility, the treatment of African Americans in the criminal justice system, general perceptions of race, and whether racism is still significant problem today." Higher scores indicate a more receptive attitude to racist beliefs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/28/racism-survey-prri-maga-republicans/).  The institute found that White evangelical Protestants and Republicans are much more likely to assume that Whites are victims.  Among [their other findings](https://www.prri.org/research/creating-more-inclusive-public-spaces-structural-racism-confederate-memorials-and-building-for-the-future/) were that "Republicans overwhelmingly back efforts to preserve the legacy of the Confederacy (85%)" and "nearly nine in 10 white Republicans (87%)... support efforts to preserve the legacy of the Confederacy."  Among religious groups, white evangelical Protestants are the most likely to support preserving the history of the Confederacy with memorials and statues (76%)" as do a majority "of white mainline Protestants (65%)."  There were a spectrum of additional findings in this polling that provide evidence about dangerous concentrations racism in United States and [the PRRI article on this effort](https://www.prri.org/research/creating-more-inclusive-public-spaces-structural-racism-confederate-memorials-and-building-for-the-future/) is worth a read.  Based on her reading of this research, Jennifer Rubin concluded that "[An aggrieved electoral minority that believes it has been victimized and is ready to deploy violence is a serious threat to an inclusive democracy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/28/racism-survey-prri-maga-republicans/)".  If you have concerns about the PRRI analysis, see the "**[Appendix C. Survey Methodology](https://www.prri.org/research/creating-more-inclusive-public-spaces-structural-racism-confederate-memorials-and-building-for-the-future/)**" before dropping this topic.  

Many Republicans and other conservatives do not push the *replacement theory* by name, but echo the tenets of *replacement theory* as part of their "*voting safety*" and anti-immigrant rhetoric.  This *dog whistle* is virtually universal among Republican candidates across the U.S. in the 2022 election season.  It is unclear who does this to *motivate the Republican base* ahead of the 2022 midterm elections and who is involved in more directly motivating far right violence (*sometimes called a ["violence entrepreneure"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/03/08/they-are-preparing-war-an-expert-civil-wars-discusses-where-political-extremists-are-taking-this-country/)*).  

Recently, an [AP-NORC poll](https://apnorc.org/projects/immigration-attitudes-and-conspiratorial-thinkers/) documented that  
>"roughly one in three (32%) adults agree that a group of people is trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants for electoral gains. A similar share (29%) also express concern that an increase in immigration is leading to to native-born Americans losing economic, political, and cultural influence. These two key measures tap into the core arguments of Replacement Theory, a decades old idea, which posits that there is a group of powerful people in this country who are trying to permanently alter the culture and voting strength of native-born Americans by bringing in large groups of immigrants  – the study indicates about one in five (17%) adults agree with both of these central tenets."  
>"...high conspiratorial thinkers are more likely than Republicans generally to believe in Replacement Theory (42% vs 26%) and express concern the election system discriminates against white Americans (38% vs 25%)."  

In late 2023 Trump repeatedly described undocumented immigrants as "poisoning the blood of our country," which appears to act as a *dog whistle* to Replacement Theory believers **and** to White Nationalist and Neo-Nazi groups.  [Isaac Arnsdorf reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/12/16/trump-authoritarians-putin-orban-poisoning-blood/) that Trump:  
>"repeated his own inflammatory language against undocumented immigrants, by accusing them of “poisoning the blood of our country” — a phrase that immigrant groups and civil rights advocates have condemned as reminiscent as Hitler in his book “Mein Kampf,” in which he told Germans to “care for the purity of their own blood” by eliminating Jews."  

[Fox News's Carlson alone has amplified the "great replacement" theory (*in which White people are supposedly targeted for marginalization*) on more than 400 episodes of his show.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/07/white-supremacist-attacks-hearing-republicans/)  

Unfortunately, profiting by feeding a brand of outrage and fear that underlies a boundless *'**our** ends justify any means'* mentality has become normalized by [GOP politicians and their professional enablers](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/gospel-donald-trump-jr/621122/) -- facilitated and amplified at scale by Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.  Simple financial gain and acquisition of raw power seem to be the foundational drivers of this 'movement' and those who profit in its execution.  What appears to be a classic private (*as compared to the same by those in political office*) example of this category of grift involves [True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/14/true-the-vote-big-lie-election-fraud/) whose Texas-based nonprofit converts *[Trump's election lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#2020_presidential_election)* -- *[Trump's Big Lie](https://www.americanoversight.org/from-voter-fraud-myths-to-bogus-election-audits-the-evolution-of-the-big-lie)* -- themes into personal wealth.  

Trump and his surrogates employ an emphasis on images of terrorism and violence they blame on liberals, [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter), *[antifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_(United_States))* and non-white immigrants (among others) -- and 'argue' that this *left wing* must be ignored, silenced, and even eliminated (depending on the venue).  In their post-election [rage against the popular vote](https://protectdemocracy.org/project/democracy-crisis-in-the-making/#section-3), Trump and his surrogates have added [increasingly explicit references to (*sometimes* including directives to do) violence against those with whom they hold grievances](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/us/politics/republican-violent-rhetoric.html).  This activity increased its references to explicit violence against perceived *enemies* through the 6 January 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol and beyond.  [IREHR documented that forty-five insurrectionist rallies also took place in thirty-two states on that day](https://www.irehr.org/2021/01/08/beyond-dc-mapping-stop-the-steal-insurrection-rallies-in-the-states/)—[making crystal clear that what happened in the nation's capital was part of a country-wide social movement also targeting state governments](https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/).  Some members of both the Senate and Congress have continued these pointed calls for *actions* against those with whom they hold grievances.  These efforts seem to be increasing conservative's willingness to entertain violence.  Examples include (*but are not limited to*):  
* Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) [espoused](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/espouse) [extremist beliefs and overtly approved of violence against prominent Democratic politicians](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-poised-to-eject-marjorie-taylor-greene-from-committees-over-extremist-remarks/2021/02/04/670601e4-6703-11eb-8468-21bc48f07fe5_story.html) and [promoted social media posts calling for the execution of Democratic leaders and federal agents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/17/house-republicans-greene-gosar/)  
* Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) [used official resources to create and post an animated video depicting the killing of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and violence against President Biden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/16/paul-gosar-video-censure-vote-aoc/).  
A [Dec. 17-19, 2021, Washington Post-University of Maryland survey](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/dec-17-19-2021-washington-post-university-of-maryland-poll/2960c330-4bbd-4b3a-af9d-72de946d7281/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_6) found 40 percent of Republicans and 41 percent of independents said that violent action against the government is sometimes justified.  As of mid-2021, Republicans are attempting to re-characterize the 6 January insurrection as a "normal tourist visit" and say [the real victims are Trump supporters getting charged with federal crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/13/great-erasure-is-now-underway-kevin-mccarthys-big-lie-confirms-it/).  A survey conducted in June 2022 ["by YouGov found that fewer than half of Republicans believe the Jan. 6 attack was "not justified"; about three-quarters say "leftists" deserve blame for the attack, roughly three times the percentage who blame Trump."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/27/with-violent-rhetoric-election-denial-podcaster-becomes-gop-force/)  Another version of this recharacterizing the events of January 6th, 2021 is captured in a Washington Post reader comment on 23 June 2022 from ["Kangaroo Court Schiff Show"]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/23/jan-6-hearings-luttig-gop-maga-trump-supporters/?commentID=3ce2754d-5b59-456d-a9e9-d3cbd795f302
):  
>"The entire country saw the **Democrat Party's Kangaroo Court Show Trial** for what it actually was: Democrats held their **fake hearing** to investigate a **fake insurrection** to cover up the **fake election** of their **fake president**."  
>"Now the problem the **Democrats** have is that **their violent Roe v Wade insurrectionists** will be showing America what **ACTUAL violence** looks like -- and what a bunch of lies the Democrats have been feeding the USA. The **Democrat-sponsored abortion loving insurrectionists** won't able to hold back from their **actual domestic terrorism**."  

...which echos and extends [efforts underway by Republican Party officials](https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1540431799129702402?s=20&t=w1rAjBFPEkO0jc_I9MkvRQ) to promote narratives about *violence by the left* that are wildly out of proportion to the truth.  [Note: In his book ["On Tyranny." Timothy Snyder](https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119) reminds us of a relevant Vaclav Havel quote, ["If the main pillar of the system is living a lie, then it is not surprising that the fundamental threat to it is living in truth."](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Power_of_the_Powerless/sscYDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=havel%20%22main%20pillar%20of%20the%20system%22&pg=PP1&printsec=frontcover&bsq=%22main%20pillar%20of%20the%20system%22)  
Even though scores of trials and years of research and investigations of *denier's* evidence have concluded there was no material fraud in the 2020 election, Trumpists and their followers continue to push Trump's Big Lie (*an activity that is then used to justify calling for violence*). In an early 2024 article on "[Debunked claims of 2020 election fraud persist](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20240106&goTo=A006&artid=0&editionStart=Des%20Moines Register)" Ken Tran, Rachel Looker, Riley Beggin and Sudiksha Kochi reported that:  
>"Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., who voted to overturn the 2020 election results, told USA TODAY, 'If I see that there is widespread fraud like I saw in the 2020 election, then absolutely I will not vote to certify.'"  

There is [another thread of Trumpist and right wing political activity](https://protectdemocracy.org/the-authoritarian-playbook/) -- introducing new laws targeting peaceful protest -- playing on the fact that U.S. legal systems bring charges against white (and Far Right) protesters at a far lower rate than against non-white protesters.  Some of these new laws add immunity from criminal and civil charges for those (assume whites) who attack these targeted protesters.  While this thread [started in 2020](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=custom&date_from=2020-01-01&date_to=2020-12-31&type=) in response to protests for racial justice, it appears to have [accellerated in 2021](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=1&type=).  

Another example of this "*violence is OK if it's against a group feared by The Right*" logic was [carried live](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/08/right-wing-rhetoric-got-guy-bronx-roughed-up-times-square/) on [Fox News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News). [Sean Hannity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity) was supporting the broader Fox campaign of fearmongering about immigrants and crime via an interview of [Curtis Sliwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sliwa). During the interview, Sliwa and/or his "[Guardian Angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Angels)" heard someone nearby [speaking Spanish and assumed the individual was a criminal immigrant](https://apnews.com/article/guardian-angels-times-square-migrants-curtis-sliwa-dacb23b7cfe0679d12642bca116543d4), and then those "Guardian Angels" assaulted that Spanish-speaking man. [Sliwa claimed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/08/right-wing-rhetoric-got-guy-bronx-roughed-up-times-square/):  
>“The Guardian Angels spotted him, stopped him. He resisted. And let’s just say we gave him a little pain compliance.” Hannity chuckled. “His mother back in Venezuela felt the vibrations. He’s sucking concrete. The cops scraped off the asphalt.”  

According to reports from Police on the scene, we learned later that all Sliwa's, Hanity's, and the nearby Guardian Angel's characterizations of the incident were imaginary and false.  [New York City police said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/08/right-wing-rhetoric-got-guy-bronx-roughed-up-times-square/) that the man was "not a migrant but a New Yorker from the Bronx" heckling the Guardian Angels.  Regardless, support for the Fox News theme of "immigration equalling crime and other dangers" was satisfied.  
More broadly Trump, Trumpists, and other anti-immigration politicians link immigrants to crime, but credible research confirms that this is a myth and not based on fact. Legal and illegal immigrants commit far less crime than *natural born* U.S. citizens.  See the [NBER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research) [research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31440) and [CATO Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute) [working paper](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-10/working-paper-60.pdf) results outlined below on this page.  

This investment in targeting non-white protestors with violence also parallels (*and supports*), for example, the [*no compromise* '*gun rights*' promoters](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/905820440/no-compromise-podcast-looks-at-a-far-right-gun-movement-and-its-playbook) who mix normalizing 'white-power' along with violence against non-whites, Jews, and *liberals* and effectively exploit Facebook's business model to grow and energize their ranks.  It also parallels ['*pro-gun extremism*' hosted on and *driven by* YouTube](https://hosted.ap.org/post-gazette/article/2d37c8ede6135eca9f0b2150e7927a92/online-pro-gun-extremism-cool-active-shooter-stuff).  

Time and again too many American leaders (political, religious, law enforcement, and more) have ignored Trump/Trumpist signaling about the next norm-crushing moves.  [Jan 1, 2022, the NYT reacted to this situation with a plea to](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/opinion/january-6-attack-committee.html):  
>"stop underestimating the threat facing the country. Countless times over the past six years, up to and including the events of Jan. 6, Mr. Trump and his allies openly projected their intent to do something outrageous or illegal or destructive. Every time, the common response was that they weren't serious or that they would never succeed. How many times will we have to be proved wrong before we take it seriously?  The sooner we do, the sooner we might hope to salvage a democracy that is in grave danger."  
There were ample [signs/flags/logos/etc of Far Right groups](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/far-right-symbols-capitol-riot/) engaging in violence on 6 Jan 2021.  

This plea seem especially relevant given the ongoing legacy of right-wing violence and Trumpers' success at tapping into it.  

In late February 2022, as Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to enter and control Ukraniane territory, ex-president Trump repeatedly praised Putin's action saying it was a "smart move" to send "the strongest peace force I've ever seen" to the Ukraine border.  On [the conservative Clay Travis & Buck Sexton show](https://www.clayandbuck.com/president-trump-with-cb-from-mar-a-lago/) Trump said that Putin's move to take parts of Ukraine "is genius,"  
>""How smart is that?" And he's gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That's strongest peace force… We could use that on our southern border. That's the strongest peace force I've ever seen. There were more army tanks than I've ever seen. They're gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here's a guy who's very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well."  
As late as December 2023, Trump was still praising Putin and [quoting Putin's recent statements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/12/16/trump-authoritarians-putin-orban-poisoning-blood/) about Democracy in America and [Putin's characterization](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/09/13/trump-putin-election-interfence/) of the many indictments against Trump.  

About U.S. President Joe Biden, Trump said "he has no concept of what he's doing."  Mike Pompeo has [said much](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/23/trump-praises-putin-ukraine-refuting-claims-tough-on-russia/) [the same](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/republicans-putin-biden-ukraine/) as has [a broader universe of the Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/technology/russia-supporters.html).  

[Meryl Kornfield reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/republicans-putin-biden-ukraine/) that Trump's praise of Putin's invation of Russian neighbor, Ukraine is in line with [a broader U.S. conservative narrative that elevates *Putin's strength and shrewdness*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/republicans-view-putin-more-favorably-than-they-do-leading-democrats/) and argues that *Putin should be left alone, or even congratulated, by Americans*.  This seems to be **because** [[M.Kornfield quote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/republicans-putin-biden-ukraine/)]  
>Putin is an authoritarian leader who has jailed [*and killed*] adversaries, shut down [*and killed*] political opposition and moved to eliminate a free press and independent judiciary.  He has dispatched his powerful military against an independent neighboring country.  

And [Amy B Wang provided additional context](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/09/13/trump-putin-election-interfence/) to the Putin statements that Trump has been highlighting:  
>“As for the prosecution of Trump, for us what is happening in today’s conditions, in my opinion, is good because it shows the rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others democracy,” Putin said at an economic forum in eastern Russia.  

Trump made clear his distain for European democracies and his admiration of *strong man* Putin's employment of violence against perceived enemies several months later at a campaign rally in Conway, South Carolina [2024-02-10] when speaking about NATO countries, and his feelings about EU country contributions to the alliance and the possibility of Putin's Russia attacking a NATO member, [Trump said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/10/trump-nato-allies-russia/) "I would not protect you" and "would encourage them (*Putin and Russia*) to do whatever the hell they want."  

Trump's and trumpist's praise for jailing adversaries, eliminating political opposition, silencing a free press and replacing an independent judiciary aligns with many others leading and participating in far right violence.  This extended and extensive *normalizing* assertions that *enemies* of the Trump tribe is supported by an analysis of autocrat's behaviors over the last 60 or more years.  Morton Halperin explained recently that "[Since the end of the Cold War, autocrats have learned that they are more likely to survive internal dissent if they turn to violence against their own people.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/06/morton-halperin-warning-electoral-autocrats-democracy/)"  

An example of this Trump tribe affection for violence is expressed in the activities of Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers (GOP), a retired U.S. Air Force pilot.  State Sen. Rogers who represents tens of thousands of constituents around the Flagstaff area has called for jailing and executing her political opponents (*and repeatedly saying they deserved the gallows*) and recently (25 Feb. 2022) called at an AFPAC converence in Orlando for violence against "traitors" who criticize Confederate Gen.

During a Veterans Day speech on November 11, 2023, Trump told a crowd in Claremont, New Hampshire, that his political enemies are “like vermin” -- *the implication being that violence and murder of "vermin" is acceptable/necessary.*  [Margaret Hartmann, wrote](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/trump-vermin-hitler.html) that both Hitler and Italy’s Benito Mussolini compared their enemies to rodents during their rise to power in the 1920s and 1930s. Trump said:
>"Today, especially, in honor of our great veterans on Veterans Day, we pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical-left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country — that lie and steal and cheat on elections and will do anything possible. They’ll do anything, whether legally or illegally, to destroy America and to destroy the American Dream."  
>"The real threat is not from the racial right; the real threat is from the radical left, and it’s growing every day. Every single day. The threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous, and grave than the threat from within. Our threat is from within. Because if you have a capable, competent, smart, tough leader — Russia, China, North Korea — they’re not going to want to play with us."  

Trump followed up by [posting the same message](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111393315342651569) on his (failing) MAGA social media platform.  

##  Far Right terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. outnumber those by any other group.  
These narratives ignore the facts about terrorist activity in the U.S.  
Since the early 1990s, far right terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. outnumber those by any other group.  
There have been **more than twice as many far right attacks and plots in the U.S.** compared to far left terrorists.  
There have been **more than six and a half times more killings by far right terrorists** than attributable to far left terrorists, and the proportion of far right killings have been increasing in the last 6 years.  Far Right extremists have been [increasingly successful at marketing race-focused (*identity*) conspiracy theories via social media](https://hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-report-2021-10-v3.pdf) and linking them to the "*need*" for violent response.  
  
*Facts* about individual's and group's ideology are not always easily defined, especially around the edges.  Analysis of the Economist and the Center for Strategic & International Studies are both included below for contrast:

For some context about how organized violence evolves, see the [transcript of a discussion with Barbara F. Walter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/03/08/they-are-preparing-war-an-expert-civil-wars-discusses-where-political-extremists-are-taking-this-country/), a political science professor at the University of California at San Diego and author of "[How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593137787)," and "[Talk of ‘Civil War,’ Ignited by Mar-a-Lago Search, Is Flaring Online.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/civil-war-social-media-trump.html)" by Ken Bensinger and Sheera Frenkel.  It appears that the pairing of Republican (*along with other 'legacy' extremest group*) normalizing of concept of using violence to express your beliefs and record-setting arms sales in the U.S. is having its intended impacts.  Recent research from the UC Davis Violence Prevention Research Program and the California Firearm Violence Research Center, ["Views of American Democracy and Society and Support for Political Violence: First Report from a Nationwide Population-Representative Survey" ](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.22277693v1) [2022-07-19] concluded that "several social trends in the United States (US) suggest an increasing risk for political violence," including lethal risks. Their research found that half of U.S. adults [*[page 14](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.22277693v1.full.pdf)*] "in the next few
years, there will be civil war in the United States" and 
>If found in a situation where they think violence is justified to advance an important political objective, about one in five respondents thinks they will likely be armed with a gun. About 7% of participants  -- which would correspond to about 18 million U.S. adults -- said they would be willing to kill a person in such a situation [*[ScienceInsider](https://www.science.org/content/article/half-of-americans-anticipate-a-us-civil-war-soon-survey-finds)*].  

And when asked about a personal willingness to use force or violence "to advance an important political objective." Researchers drilled down on the types of violence that would include [*[page 14](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.22277693v1.full.pdf)*].  Among these respondents:  
>13.7% were at least somewhat willing to use force or violence "to damage property,"  
>12.2% "to threaten or intimidate a person,"  
>10.4% "to injure a person," and  
>7.1% "to kill a person"  

A key conclusion of this research was: "Substantial minorities of the population endorse violence, including lethal violence, to obtain political objectives."  While researchers did not map respondents to specific political parties or to other groups, a review of [the questions and detailed responses](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.22277693v1.full.pdf) seem to suggest that more Far Right issues/concerns are aligned with a willingness to engage in violence, than are issues associated with Far Left or otherwise *Liberal* populations.

Timothy Snyder argues that for many, a human tendency to associate things that we desire and wish for with 'inevitability' underlies a powerful belief system -- one that shapes and colors much of what we do and what we don't do.  A thread of his work outlines how many in the West have ignored Far Right violence, Trump and Trumpism, a rise in the presence of authoritarianism globally, and now Putin's war because they all seem out of phase with a belief in the inevitability of Western democracy and freedom.  They have often been explained as irrational (from the perspective of that belief in inevitability and predictability) and shunted aside.  He suggests that we all need to be more sensitive to and to better understand the plurality of beliefs and values that surround us and to work toward our goals within that real world. (*more, and re-write to come in this paragraph*) A transcript of an excellent interview with him on this topic is available at: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-timothy-snyder.html?showTranscript=1](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-timothy-snyder.html?showTranscript=1)

Why do some individuals and groups choose authoritarianism, vigilantism, and ideological violence?  Thomas B. Edsall wrote an interesting essay about research addressing that and related questions.  See "Trump True Believers Have Their Reasons." By Thomas B. Edsall, 2021-10-06 [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/opinion/trump-voters-2020-election.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/opinion/trump-voters-2020-election.html)  

The [Center for Systemic Peace](https://www.systemicpeace.org/) has developed a model for measuring and evaluating the state and trajectory of complex societal systems.  The organization released a [video book](https://www.systemicpeace.org/videobook.html) and accompanying PDF *[storyboard](https://www.systemicpeace.org/assets/managing-complexity-mgmarshall-6Jan2016rev.pdf)* by which the video book.  These resources can be instructive when thinking about how at the Federal and State levels in the United States we see increasing **anocracy** (*an unstable combination of democracy and autocratic authority/authoritarianism*) and populations organizing politically, not around ideology but almost exclusively around **identity** (*ethnic, religious or racial identity*).  

Social media platforms facilitate increasingly successful marketing of 'antisemitism + conspiracy theories + calls to violence:' "Antisemitism in the Digital Age." By Gregory Davis, Morgan Finnsiö, Patrik Hermansson, David Lawrence, Joe Mulhall, Simone Rafael, Veronika Kracher, Theresa Lehmann, and Eva Kappl; Edited by Joe Mulhall, October 2021 [https://hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-report-2021-10-v3.pdf](https://hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-report-2021-10-v3.pdf) and "Covid conspiracy theories are driving people to antisemitism online." by Charlotte Jee [https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/13/1037035/covid-conspiracy-theories-are-driving-people-to-antisemitism-online/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/13/1037035/covid-conspiracy-theories-are-driving-people-to-antisemitism-online/).  The [Center for Antisemitism Research](https://www.adl.org/research-centers/center-antisemitism-research) 2022 survey of [Antisemitic Attitudes in America](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitic-attitudes-america-topline-findings) "identified widespread belief in anti-Jewish tropes at rates unseen for decades."  Also that these beliefs were increasing in younger populations (*circle back to **social media** above*). For more detail see: ["Antisemitic Attitudes in America: Topline Findings."](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitic-attitudes-america-topline-findings)  

Far Right influencers, Trump, Trumpists, and other anti-immigration politicians push a theory that immigrants/migrants commit a disproportionate number of crimes -- and thus present a *special* threat. The fact is that studies continue to show that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born U.S. citizens. The [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org) sponsored research that found [since 1960](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31440) "immigrants have become less likely to be incarcerated than white US-born men, with immigrants being 30% less likely to be incarcerated today". And "If we compare immigrants to the broader US-born population (including non-white individuals), then immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated in recent years." 
(NBER researchers reviewed](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31440) "arrest records from Texas between 2012–2018 and (found) that both unauthorized and legal immigrants are less likely to be arrested than US-born citizens."  The report's authors [concluded](https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/mythical-tie-between-immigration-and-crime) that immigrants are not "the rapists and drug dealers that anti-immigrant politicians claim them to be."  [Cato Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute) [working paper by Alex Nowrasteh, Andrew C. Forrester, and Michelangelo Landgrave found that](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-10/working-paper-60.pdf) legal and illegal immigrants have a crime rate far below that of native-born Americans.  Even in states like Texas, where anti-immigrant fever seems to *own* politicians in power and "has the second-largest illegal immigrant population of any state," "the illegal immigrant criminal conviction rate was 45 percent below that of native-born Americans in Texas. The legal immigrant criminal conviction rate was 62 percent below that of native-born Americans." Texas is the only state that records criminal convictions and arrests by immigration status, so the researchers have high confidence in their results.  

There appear to be intersections with a subset of far right violence and an important subset of those in the policing profession who "consider themselves not servants of the law, but the law itself and the law entire, above the rules, beyond accountability and answerable to no one."  "Power unrestrained serves only itself." By Leonard Pitts  [https://triblive.com/opinion/leonard-pitts-jr-power-unrestrained-serves-only-itself/](https://triblive.com/opinion/leonard-pitts-jr-power-unrestrained-serves-only-itself/).  **This is NOT a condemnation of all police.**  Only an observation based on living in a few different cities, travelling a bit, and reading the news for decades while recognizing that policing is a special profession where increasingly heavily armed individuals are tasked with enforcing the laws of our nation, their state and applicable 'local' mandates, and protecting 'civilians.'  And in that context, there does not seem to be sufficient success at managing who is permitted into that profession, who is promoted and who [*defined by their behaviors*] is retained in that profession.  Unfortunately I could find little useful data about police, policing, and far right violence.  For important issues, decision data needs to be accurate and properly contextualized.  As far as I can tell, there are no requirements that policing organizations in the U.S. report officer-involved violence to any centralized entity to support effective analysis, reporting, and more informed decision-making.  It seems like we need (for a number of reasons, not limited to far-right violence) rich, comprehensive, accurate and properly contextualized data about police and policing in the U.S.  

[Larry Pratt has been a influential force in a broad spectrum of measures across the U.S.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/larry-pratt) demanding unrestricted distribution of firearms in conjunction with establishment of a theocratic society based on what he describes as Old Testament civil and religious laws.  

There appears to be a special relationship between Far Right Violence and guns (although the reverse is not evident, guns nor gun ownership cause Far Right Violence).  For fact-based information about guns and gun ownship, see: [https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/](https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/).  There is also reputable reporting that gun sales/gun ownership in the U.S. is a far more complex than my assertion might imply.  For an excellent example, see "Fearing violence and political uncertainty, Americans are buying millions more firearms" by Hannah Denham and Andrew Ba Tran [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/)  And then there is [the model](https://robertpjones.substack.com/p/free-as-f-kyle-rittenhouse-whiteness) of bringing arms to events to help incite violence, and then use that danger, one they helped to create, to justify initiating or participating in violent behaviors.  *Lets take a moment to acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice made by so many of our school children in the United States to protect gun owners, the gun lobbies, gun/ammunition manufacturers, and the slice of our political/legal class who enable them*. (On 4 Jan 2024 I listened to an approximation of this 'quote' as an individual read aloud a photo of a sign they were viewing on Facebook and thought it fit well here.)  

Strains associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may play a role in recent far right violence.  See an interesting essay -- ["In Medieval Europe, a Pandemic Changed Work Forever. Can It Happen Again?"](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/opinion/sunday/covid-plague-work-labor.html) --on this topic by M.T. Anderson.  

The [Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights (IREHR) reported in May 2022](https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/appendix-a-legislator-membership-in-far-right-facebook-groups/) that state legislators across the U.S. were members of one or more Far-Right group on Facebook ([789 far-right groups were joined by these state legislators](https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/)).  In Iowa, for example, [at least 15 Republican state legislators (Iowa House and Senate) belong to one or more "*Far-Right*" Facebook group emphasing one or more of the following topics: COVID Denial (*Anti-Vaxx, Anti-Mask, and/or Anti-Lockdown*), Anti-Abortion, "Tea Party," or "Constitutionally-Constructed Nationalism" (*2nd Amendment*)](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/05/22/report-says-hundreds-of-state-legislators-have-joined-far-right-facebook-groups/).  

When so many profit by feeding fear and outrage by generating a constant flow of misinformation via channels designed to amplify those messages, each individual's critical thinking skills -- their ability to understand and evaluate content and, at a minimum, determine truth from falsehood -- are society's last line of defense.  Support efforts to strengthen critical thinking, media literacy, and extensive exposure to *other's* perspectives especially through our schools and colleges.  We need the next generations to be better-informed citizens by better decoding *news and other messaging*.  

In that context, the [Associated Press has published guidance](https://blog.ap.org/standards-around-generative-ai) for their *reporters* that reminds all content producers that gGenerative AI makes it even easier for people to intentionally spread mis- and disinformation through altered words, photos, video or audio, including content that may have no signs of alteration, appearing realistic and authentic.  

None of this is to imply that White grievance is associated with fantasy alone.  The *best* [propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda) incorporates verifiable *facts* into its narrative.  The threads of grievance and outrage at *protesters, rioters, and looters* associated with what adherents often label as "*[Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter)*" are associated with collections ([*for example*](https://github.com/xnhl/riots)) of (curated, opinionated, or otherwise) of *real data* (*sometimes lacking context via ideologically driven selectivity*).  

It seems like one path to addressing this constellation of issues is to focus on better-functioning and more effective democracy.  One foundational thread of that work requires comprehensive civility to one another throughout governing and governmental bodies in the spirit of [John F. Kennedy's inaugural quote](https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/inaugural-address-19610120) on the topic:  
>So let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate. Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.  

The [Edelman Trust Barometer 2022](https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2022-01/2022%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20FINAL_Jan25.pdf) survey found that government and media were viewed as strongly dividing forces by participants([page 6](https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2022-01/2022%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20FINAL_Jan25.pdf)).  The researchers concluded on [page 12](https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2022-01/2022%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20FINAL_Jan25.pdf) that "government and media feed (a) cycle of division and disinformation for votes and clicks."  The intensity of this distrust has been growing for more than 5 years and seems to support the idea that our elected representatives are not living up to President Kennedy's plea for civility and unity.  

The U.S. House of Representatives voted May 18, 2022 on and passed the ["Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022" (H.R.350)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/350), which permits/enables more sharing of information about domestic terrorism among government departments (*all Republicans voted against it*).  Notably, it also creates an interagency task force to analyze and combat white supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of the uniformed services and federal law enforcement agencies.  There have been [104 U.S. House laws and resolutions associated with "white supremacist" activity -- 97 of them since 2008](https://www.congress.gov/search?q={%22source%22:%22legislation%22,%22search%22:%22\%22white%20supremacist\%22%22}&pageSort=dateOfIntroduction%3Adesc).  

The Far Right wing of the U.S. Supreme Court (which I view as Justice Alito, Justice Thomas, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Barrett, and *usually* Justice Kavanaugh) spent too much of 2021 inventing new contexts to reject consideration of race in the law, find discrimination in the separation of church and state and in constraints on gun ownership and in anything that impinges on what they view as the U.S. constition's "colorblindness," and shrink the scope of U.S. regulatory agencies, plus simple support for virtually all anti-abortion actions, and election manipulation efforts.  I track some of that activity [on another page](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/Grassleys-Supreme-Court.md).  This hostility to legal and democratic norms seems aligned (*intentional or not*) with some of the ugliest Far Right organizations in the U.S. as well as analogous ugliness in some other Western countries.

#### ToDo: 
* Defining "Far-Right" --> [https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/chapter-4-the-far-right-groups/](https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/chapter-4-the-far-right-groups/)  
* Do some research on the Constitutional Sheriff and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA) to see if their activities belong on this page.  Their founding premise that "the county sheriff is the definitive law officer constitutionally" and their assertions that county sheriffs determine whether to enforce given laws based on their *understanding of the constitution*.  
* Do some research on the intersection of violent individuals & groups within political & religious conservatives and the "manosphere" [male supremacist activists, men’s rights activism (MRA) and “involuntary celibates” (incels)](https://www.isdglobal.org/explainers/the-manosphere-explainer/.) and [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/).  
* There is research about an empathy bias for members of one's own tribe/group.  See if any of that research if related to Far Right violence.  
* An essay by [Thomas B. Edsall](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/22/opinion/democrats-republicans-education-racial-resentment.html) pointed to a collection of research on Right/Left extremes.  
Review these:  
  * [Michael Podhorzer](https://aflcio.org/author/michael-podhorzer), a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., in “[The Congressional Class Reversal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0RH8sqV33BzLLA6V1tXmwLMbmGhoEcVEhA8Fg7aiL0/edit?_hsmi=240137472&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9LFTPUffAFrlHo1qXrmnLoldowdsdjOyw680aOJ3vFZDbHyzbyCWIfqyYlkjXWYvH5eOFuQOYGc5Kkm2zJYOElNP0Fpx5_ekJsiM2LRIYsrOL1Fxk#heading=h.gjdgxs),” “[Socioeconomic Polarization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LD8qDSyhXbYGnrXnfwtS_PZd1diaWojxxEF7LNY4ty4/edit?_hsmi=240137472&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Hr4pX49LVRmG7N1HS0lfn-Robrh_zgPak2-wzvoPF843EWvqcN7xYJuD9ksSyhQCzBKx6DR9-drNH0T4NXC19H7cqPSpmvgF4PJxAhVqytvrPd5)” and “[Education Polarization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gCSiTEp8BE8-BpcG9ew2uVZuBQ8LZNIu/view)”;

* What is the "Crowdsourcers for Culture and Liberty" led by Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas?  What do they spend their money on?  What do they lobby for? And where does their money come from? start with: "[Activist group led by Ginni Thomas received nearly $600,000 in anonymous donations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/03/28/ginni-thomas-crowdsourcers-anonymous-donations/)" By Shawn Boburg and Emma Brown.  
* Some are not familiar with "*Christian*" (or other religion's) *foundational texts*.  Here are some freely-available (human and machine friendly) religious texts: [https://alex.macrocosm.so/religion](https://alex.macrocosm.so/religion) and more at [https://github.com/macrocosmcorp/tenet/tree/main/religious-texts](https://github.com/macrocosmcorp/tenet/tree/main/religious-texts).  Figure out how we might make this "*data*" more broadly useful to those who want to better understand those who claim their cause/behavior is based on one or more of these foundational texts.  
* I saw the following resource in an article about extremist activity in the military: "Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States" database maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. I have not yet reviewed it.   
* You may see symbols used by those involved in Far Right violence (or calling for it).  The ADL maintains a useful database: "Hate on Display™ [Hate Symbols Database](https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbols/search) for identifying meaning in those symbols.  This database provides an overview of many of the symbols most frequently used by a variety of white supremacist groups and movements, as well as some other types of hate groups.
