## Attempts to Demonize and Silence Critics of Trumpism Ignore Facts About Violence & Terrorism in U.S.  

Trump and Trumpists blame Democratic candidates, the Democratic party, Black Lives Matter, and *antifa* (*the 'radical left' in general*) for economic and broader societal problems.  Leading up to and after the November 2020 elections, they added *a vast conspiracy resulting in corruption of the popular vote*.  There is [increasing evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/us/politics/trump-right-wing-domestic-terrorism.html) that this program of misinformation was pushed into the management ranks of U.S. justice and intelligence services so that it became a systemic force to de-emphasize far right threats in favor of *finding* left threats.  

Trump and his surrogates employ an increasing emphasis on images of terrorism and violence they blame on liberals, Black Lives Matter, and antifa (among others) -- and 'argue' that this left wing must be ignored, silenced, and even eliminated (depending on the venue).  In their post-election rage against the popular vote, Trump and his surrogates have added increasingly explicit references to (*sometimes* including directives to do) violence against those with whom they hold grievances.  This activity increased in its references to explicit violence against perceived *enemies* through the 6 January 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol and beyond.  Some members of both the Senate and Congress have continued these pointed calls for *actions* against those with whom they hold grievances.  

There is another thread of Trumpist and right wing political activity -- introducing new laws targeting peaceful protest -- playing on the fact that U.S. legal systems bring charges against white (and Far Right) protesters at a far lower rate than against non-white protesters.  Some of these new laws add immunity from criminal and civil charges for those (assume whites) who attack these targeted protesters.  While this thread [started in 2020](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=custom&date_from=2020-01-01&date_to=2020-12-31&type=) in response to protests for racial justice , it appears to have [accellerated in 2021](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=1&type=).  

This narrative ignores the facts about terrorist activity in the U.S.  
Since the early 1990s, far right terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. outnumber those by any other group.  
There have been **more than twice as many far right attacks and plots in the U.S.** compared to far left terrorists.  
There have been **more than six and a half times more killings by far right terrorists** than attributable to far left terrorists, and the proportion of far right killings have been increasing in the last 6 years.  
  
*Facts* about individual's and group's ideology are not always easily defined, especially around the edges.  Analysis of the Economist and the Center for Strategic & International Studies are both included below for contrast:
