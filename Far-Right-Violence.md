## Attempts to Demonize and Silence Critics of Trumpism Ignore Facts About Violence & Terrorism in U.S.  

In recent decades, right-wing extremism has resulted in materially greater levels of violence and death than left-wing extremism.
>[Since 2015, right-wing extremists have been involved in 267 plots or attacks and 91 fatalities, the data shows. At the same time, attacks and plots ascribed to far-left views accounted for 66 incidents leading to 19 deaths](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/).  

Trump and Trumpists blame -- with a mix of outrage and fear -- Democratic candidates, the Democratic party, Black Lives Matter, *antifa* (*the 'radical left' in general*), *libs* and non-white *immigrants/migrants ("them")* for economic and broader societal problems.  Leading up to and after the November 2020 elections, they helped birth and amplified *a vast conspiracy resulting in corruption of the popular vote* adding outrage at and fear of the democratic process and democracy itself.  There is [increasing evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/us/politics/trump-right-wing-domestic-terrorism.html) that this program of misinformation was also pushed into the management ranks of U.S. justice and intelligence services so that it became a systemic force to de-emphasize far right threats in favor of *finding* and *attacking* threats from the left and from non-whites.  

Concurrently, a material subset of the white evangelical demographic in America continues convulsing White grievance and increasingly violent rhetoric about attacks on (their) America.  [Race and/or religious identity seem central to their motivations](https://religiondispatches.org/how-far-will-white-christians-go-to-maintain-power-an-interview-with-robert-jones/).  Also see podcaster Joe Oltmann, who sells [his daily vision of America’s dark and violent future](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/27/with-violent-rhetoric-election-denial-podcaster-becomes-gop-force/).  
>“Pretty soon we’ll have gallows being built all over the country. We can take care of all these traitors to our nation,” he told listeners during an episode late last year. ... “If you’re going to take our way of life away from us, you’re not going to do it without blood spilled.”  

[Ronald Brownstein summarized](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/23/politics/race-immigration-replacement-theory-demographics/index.html) the role of "*replacement theory*" in this mix:  
>"Far right White supremacist groups, conservative media personalities and now Republicans in Congress are trying to inflame nativist feelings among conservative Whites by warning that liberals want immigrants to "replace" native-born Americans in the nation's culture and electorate."    

Many Republicans and other conservatives do not push the *replacement theory* by name, but echo the tenets of *replacement theory* as part of their "*voting safety*" and anti-immigrant rhetoric.  This *dog whistle* is virtually universal among Republican candidates across the U.S. in the 2022 election season.  It is unclear who does this to *motivate the Republican base* ahead of the 2022 midterm elections and who is involved in more directly motivating far right violence.  

Recently, an [AP-NORC poll](https://apnorc.org/projects/immigration-attitudes-and-conspiratorial-thinkers/) documented that 
>"roughly one in three (32%) adults agree that a group of people is trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants for electoral gains. A similar share (29%) also express concern that an increase in immigration is leading to to native-born Americans losing economic, political, and cultural influence. These two key measures tap into the core arguments of Replacement Theory, a decades old idea, which posits that there is a group of powerful people in this country who are trying to permanently alter the culture and voting strength of native-born Americans by bringing in large groups of immigrants  – the study indicates about one in five (17%) adults agree with both of these central tenets."  
>"...high conspiratorial thinkers are more likely than Republicans generally to believe in Replacement Theory (42% vs 26%) and express concern the election system discriminates against white Americans (38% vs 25%)."  

[Fox News's Carlson alone has amplified the "great replacement" theory (in which White people are supposedly targeted for marginalization) on more than 400 episodes of his show.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/07/white-supremacist-attacks-hearing-republicans/)  

*Unfortunately, profiting by feeding a brand of outrage and fear that underlies a boundless '**our** ends justify any means' mentality has become normalized by [GOP politicians and their professional enablers](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/gospel-donald-trump-jr/621122/) -- facilitated and amplified at scale by Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.  Simple financial gain and acquisition of raw power seem to be the foundational drivers of this 'movement' and those who profit in its execution.*  

Trump and his surrogates employ an emphasis on images of terrorism and violence they blame on liberals, Black Lives Matter, antifa, and non-white immigrants (among others) -- and 'argue' that this *left wing* must be ignored, silenced, and even eliminated (depending on the venue).  In their post-election [rage against the popular vote](https://protectdemocracy.org/project/democracy-crisis-in-the-making/#section-3), Trump and his surrogates have added [increasingly explicit references to (*sometimes* including directives to do) violence against those with whom they hold grievances](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/us/politics/republican-violent-rhetoric.html).  This activity increased its references to explicit violence against perceived *enemies* through the 6 January 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol and beyond.  [IREHR documented that forty-five insurrectionist rallies also took place in thirty-two states on that day](https://www.irehr.org/2021/01/08/beyond-dc-mapping-stop-the-steal-insurrection-rallies-in-the-states/)—[making crystal clear that what happened in the nation’s capital was part of a country-wide social movement also targeting state governments](https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/).  Some members of both the Senate and Congress have continued these pointed calls for *actions* against those with whom they hold grievances.  These efforts seem to be increasing conservative's willingness to entertain violence.  A [Dec. 17-19, 2021, Washington Post-University of Maryland survey](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/dec-17-19-2021-washington-post-university-of-maryland-poll/2960c330-4bbd-4b3a-af9d-72de946d7281/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_6) found 40 percent of Republicans and 41 percent of independents said that violent action against the government is sometimes justified.  As of mid-2021, Republicans are attempting to re-characterize the 6 January insurrection as a "normal tourist visit" and say [the real victims are Trump supporters getting charged with federal crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/13/great-erasure-is-now-underway-kevin-mccarthys-big-lie-confirms-it/).  A survey conducted in June 2022 ["by YouGov found that fewer than half of Republicans believe the Jan. 6 attack was “not justified”; about three-quarters say “leftists” deserve blame for the attack, roughly three times the percentage who blame Trump."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/27/with-violent-rhetoric-election-denial-podcaster-becomes-gop-force/)  Another version of this recharacterizing the events of January 6th, 2021 is captured in a Washington Post reader comment from ["Kangaroo Court Schiff Show"]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/23/jan-6-hearings-luttig-gop-maga-trump-supporters/?commentID=3ce2754d-5b59-456d-a9e9-d3cbd795f302
):  
>The entire country saw the **Democrat Party's Kangaroo Court Show Trial** for what it actually was: Democrats held their **fake hearing** to investigate a **fake insurrection** to cover up the **fake election** of their **fake president**.  
>Now the problem the **Democrats** have is that **their violent Roe v Wade insurrectionists** will be showing America what **ACTUAL violence** looks like -- and what a bunch of lies the Democrats have been feeding the USA. The **Democrat-sponsored abortion loving insurrectionists** won't able to hold back from their **actual domestic terrorism**.  

...which echos and extends [efforts underway by Republican Party officials](https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1540431799129702402?s=20&t=w1rAjBFPEkO0jc_I9MkvRQ) to promote narratives about *violence by the left*.

There is [another thread of Trumpist and right wing political activity](https://protectdemocracy.org/the-authoritarian-playbook/) -- introducing new laws targeting peaceful protest -- playing on the fact that U.S. legal systems bring charges against white (and Far Right) protesters at a far lower rate than against non-white protesters.  Some of these new laws add immunity from criminal and civil charges for those (assume whites) who attack these targeted protesters.  While this thread [started in 2020](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=custom&date_from=2020-01-01&date_to=2020-12-31&type=) in response to protests for racial justice , it appears to have [accellerated in 2021](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=1&type=).  This activity also parallels (*and supports*), for example, the [*no compromise* '*gun rights*' promoters](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/905820440/no-compromise-podcast-looks-at-a-far-right-gun-movement-and-its-playbook) who mix normalizing 'white-power' along with violence against non-whites, Jews, and *liberals* and effectively exploit Facebook's business model to grow and energize their ranks.  It also parallels ['*pro-gun extremism*' hosted on and *driven by* YouTube](https://hosted.ap.org/post-gazette/article/2d37c8ede6135eca9f0b2150e7927a92/online-pro-gun-extremism-cool-active-shooter-stuff).  

Time and again too many American leaders (political, religious, law enforcement, and more) have ignored Trump/Trumpist signaling about the next norm-crushing moves.  [Jan 1, 2022, the NYT reacted to this situation with a plea to](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/opinion/january-6-attack-committee.html): 
>"stop underestimating the threat facing the country. Countless times over the past six years, up to and including the events of Jan. 6, Mr. Trump and his allies openly projected their intent to do something outrageous or illegal or destructive. Every time, the common response was that they weren't serious or that they would never succeed. How many times will we have to be proved wrong before we take it seriously?  The sooner we do, the sooner we might hope to salvage a democracy that is in grave danger."  

This plea seem especially relevant given the ongoing legacy of right-wing violence and Trumpers' success at tapping into it.  

In late February 2022, as Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to enter and control Ukraniane territory, ex-president Trump repeatedly praised Putin's action saying it was a "smart move" to send "the strongest peace force I've ever seen" to the Ukraine border.  On [the conservative Clay Travis & Buck Sexton show](https://www.clayandbuck.com/president-trump-with-cb-from-mar-a-lago/) Trump said that Putin's move to take parts of Ukraine "is genius," 
>""How smart is that?" And he's gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That's strongest peace force… We could use that on our southern border. That's the strongest peace force I've ever seen. There were more army tanks than I've ever seen. They're gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here's a guy who's very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well."  

About U.S. President Joe Biden, Trump said "he has no concept of what he's doing."  Mike Pompeo has [said much](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/23/trump-praises-putin-ukraine-refuting-claims-tough-on-russia/) [the same](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/republicans-putin-biden-ukraine/) as has [a broader universe of the Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/technology/russia-supporters.html).  

[Meryl Kornfield reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/republicans-putin-biden-ukraine/) that Trump's praise of Putin's invation of Russian neighbor, Ukraine is in line with [a broader U.S. conservative narrative that elevates *Putin's strength and shrewdness*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/republicans-view-putin-more-favorably-than-they-do-leading-democrats/) and argues that *Putin should be left alone, or even congratulated, by Americans*.  This seems to be **because** [[M.Kornfield quote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/republicans-putin-biden-ukraine/)]  
>Putin is an authoritarian leader who has jailed [*and killed*] adversaries, shut down [*and killed*] political opposition and moved to eliminate a free press and independent judiciary.  He has dispatched his powerful military against an independent neighboring country.  

Praise for jailing adversaries, eliminating political opposition, silencing a free press and replacing an independent judiciary aligns with many leading and participating in far right violence.  

Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers (GOP), a retired U.S. Air Force pilot, represents tens of thousands of constituents around the Flagstaff area has called for jailing and executing her political opponents (*and repeatedly saying they deserved the gallows*) and recently (25 Feb. 2022) called at an AFPAC converence in Orlando for violence against "traitors" who criticize Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee or who promote coronavirus vaccination.  She is also described by Beth Reinhard and Rosalind S. Helderman as ["the most successful fundraiser in the Arizona state legislature."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/03/08/wendy-rogers-arizona-nick-fuentes-censure/)  

These narratives ignore the facts about terrorist activity in the U.S.  
Since the early 1990s, far right terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. outnumber those by any other group.  
There have been **more than twice as many far right attacks and plots in the U.S.** compared to far left terrorists.  
There have been **more than six and a half times more killings by far right terrorists** than attributable to far left terrorists, and the proportion of far right killings have been increasing in the last 6 years.  Far Right extremists have been [increasingly successful at marketing race-focused conspiracy theories via social media](https://hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-report-2021-10-v3.pdf) and linking them to the "*need*" for violent response.  
  
*Facts* about individual's and group's ideology are not always easily defined, especially around the edges.  Analysis of the Economist and the Center for Strategic & International Studies are both included below for contrast:

Timothy Snyder argues that for many, a human tendency to associate things that we desire and wish for with 'inevitability' underlies a powerful belief system -- one that shapes and colors much of what we do and what we don't do.  A thread of his work outlines how many in the West have ignored Far Right violence, Trump and Trumpism, a rise in the presence of authoritarianism globally, and now Putin's war because they all seem out of phase with a belief in the inevitability of Western democracy and freedom.  They have often been explained as irrational (from the perspective of that belief in inevitability and predictability) and shunted aside.  He suggests that we all need to be more sensitive to and to better understand the plurality of beliefs and values that surround us and to work toward our goals within that real world. (*more, and re-write to come in this paragraph*) A transcript of an excellent interview with him on this topic is available at: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-timothy-snyder.html?showTranscript=1](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-timothy-snyder.html?showTranscript=1)

Why do some individuals and groups choose authoritarianism, vigilantism, and ideological violence?  Thomas B. Edsall wrote an interesting essay about research addressing that and related questions.  See "Trump True Believers Have Their Reasons." By Thomas B.

There appear to be intersections with a subset of far right violence and an important subset of those in the policing profession who "consider themselves not servants of the law, but the law itself and the law entire, above the rules, beyond accountability and answerable to no one."  "Power unrestrained serves only itself." By Leonard Pitts  [https://triblive.com/opinion/leonard-pitts-jr-power-unrestrained-serves-only-itself/](https://triblive.com/opinion/leonard-pitts-jr-power-unrestrained-serves-only-itself/).  This is NOT a condemnation of all police.  Only an observation based on living in a few different cities, reading the news for decades and recognizing that policing is a special profession where increasingly heavily armed individuals are tasked with enforcing the laws of our nation, their state and applicable 'local' mandates, while protecting 'civilians.'  And in that context, there does not seem to be sufficient success at managing who is permitted into that profession, who is promoted and who [defined by their behaviors] is retained in that profession.  Unfortunately I could find little useful data about police, policing, and far right violence.  For important issues, decision data needs to be accurate and properly contextualized.  As far as I can tell, there are no requirements that policing organizations in the U.S. report officer-involved violence to any centralized entity to support effective analysis, reporting, and more informed decision-making.  It seems like we need (for a number of reasons, not limited to far-right violence) rich, comprehensive, accurate and properly contextualized data about police and policing in the U.S.  

[Larry Pratt has been a influential force in a broad spectrum of measures across the U.S.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/larry-pratt) demanding unrestricted distribution of firearms in conjunction with establishment of a theocratic society based on what he describes as Old Testament civil and religious laws.  

When so many profit by feeding fear and outrage by generating a constant flow of misinformation via channels designed to amplify those messages, each individual's critical thinking skills -- their ability to understand and evaluate content and, at a minimum, determine truth from falsehood -- are society's last line of defense.  Support efforts to strengthen critical thinking, media literacy, and extensive exposure to *other's* perspectives especially through our schools and colleges.  We need the next generations to be better-informed citizens by better decoding *news and other messaging*.  

None of this is to imply that White grievance is associated with fantasy alone.  The *best* propaganda incorporates verifiable *facts* into it narrative.  The threads of grievance and outrage at *protesters, rioters, and looters* associated with what adherents often label as "*Black Lives Matter*" are associated with collections ([*for example*](https://github.com/xnhl/riots)) (curated, opinionated, or otherwise) of *real data*.  

There appears to be a special relationship between Far Right Violence and guns (although the reverse is not evident, guns nor gun ownership cause Far Right Violence).  For fact-based information about guns and gun ownship, see: [https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/](https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/).  There is also reputable reporting that gun sales/gun ownership in the U.S. is a far more complex than my assertion might imply.  For an excellent example, see "Fearing violence and political uncertainty, Americans are buying millions more firearms" by Hannah Denham and Andrew Ba Tran [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/)  And then there is [the model](https://robertpjones.substack.com/p/free-as-f-kyle-rittenhouse-whiteness) of bringing arms to events to help incite violence, and then use that danger, one they helpte to create, to justify initiating or participating in violent behaviors.  

Strains associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may play a role in recent far right violence.  See an interesting essay -- ["In Medieval Europe, a Pandemic Changed Work Forever. Can It Happen Again?"](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/opinion/sunday/covid-plague-work-labor.html) --on this topic by M.T. Anderson.  

The [Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights (IREHR) reported in May 2022](https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/appendix-a-legislator-membership-in-far-right-facebook-groups/) that state legislators across the U.S. were members of one or more Far-Right group on Facebook ([789 far-right groups were joined by these state legislators](https://www.irehr.org/reports/breaching-the-mainstream/)).  In Iowa, for example, [at least 15 Republican state legislators (Iowa House and Senate) belong to one or more "*Far-Right*" Facebook group emphasing one or more of the following topics: COVID Denial (*Anti-Vaxx, Anti-Mask, and/or Anti-Lockdown*), Anti-Abortion, "Tea Party," or "Constitutionally-Constructed Nationalism" (*2nd Amendment*)](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/05/22/report-says-hundreds-of-state-legislators-have-joined-far-right-facebook-groups/).  

It seems like one path to addressing this constellation of issues is to focus on better-functioning and more effective democracy.  One foundational thread of that work requires comprehensive civility to one another throughout governing and governmental bodies in the spirit of [John F. Kennedy's inaugural quote](https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/inaugural-address-19610120) on the topic:  
>So let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate. Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.  

The U.S. House of Representatives voted May 18, 2022 on and passed the ["Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022" (H.R.350)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/350), which permits/enables more sharing of information about domestic terrorism among government departments (*all Republicans voted against it*).  Notably, it also creates an interagency task force to analyze and combat white supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of the uniformed services and federal law enforcement agencies.  There have been [104 U.S. House laws and resolutions associated with "white supremacist" activity -- 97 of them since 2008](https://www.congress.gov/search?q={%22source%22:%22legislation%22,%22search%22:%22\%22white%20supremacist\%22%22}&pageSort=dateOfIntroduction%3Adesc).
