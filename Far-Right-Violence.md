## Attempts to Demonize and Silence Critics of Trumpism Ignore Facts About Violence & Terrorism in U.S.  

Trump and Trumpists blame -- with a mix of outrage and fear -- Democratic candidates, the Democratic party, Black Lives Matter, *antifa* (*the 'radical left' in general*) and non-white *immigrants/migrants* for economic and broader societal problems.  Leading up to and after the November 2020 elections, they birthed *a vast conspiracy resulting in corruption of the popular vote* adding outrage at and fear of the democratic process and democracy itself.  There is [increasing evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/us/politics/trump-right-wing-domestic-terrorism.html) that this program of misinformation was pushed into the management ranks of U.S. justice and intelligence services so that it became a systemic force to de-emphasize far right threats in favor of *finding* threats from the left.  

Concurrently, a material subset of the white evangelical demographic in America continues convulsing White grievance and increasingly violent rhetoric about attacks on (their) America.  [Race and/or religious identity seem central to their motivations](https://religiondispatches.org/how-far-will-white-christians-go-to-maintain-power-an-interview-with-robert-jones/).  

*Unfortunately, profiting by feeding a brand of outrage and fear that underlies a boundless '**our** ends justify any means' mentality has become normalized by [GOP politicians and their professional enablers](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/gospel-donald-trump-jr/621122/) -- facilitated and amplified at scale by Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.  Simple financial gain and acquisition of raw power seem to be the foundational drivers of this 'movement' and those who profit in its execution.*  

Trump and his surrogates employ an emphasis on images of terrorism and violence they blame on liberals, Black Lives Matter, antifa, and non-white immigrants (among others) -- and 'argue' that this *left wing* must be ignored, silenced, and even eliminated (depending on the venue).  In their post-election [rage against the popular vote](https://protectdemocracy.org/project/democracy-crisis-in-the-making/#section-3), Trump and his surrogates have added [increasingly explicit references to (*sometimes* including directives to do) violence against those with whom they hold grievances](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/us/politics/republican-violent-rhetoric.html).  This activity increased its references to explicit violence against perceived *enemies* through the 6 January 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol and beyond.  Some members of both the Senate and Congress have continued these pointed calls for *actions* against those with whom they hold grievances.  These efforts seem to be increasing conservative's willingness to entertain violence.  A [Dec. 17-19, 2021, Washington Post-University of Maryland survey](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/dec-17-19-2021-washington-post-university-of-maryland-poll/2960c330-4bbd-4b3a-af9d-72de946d7281/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_6) found 40 percent of Republicans and 41 percent of independents said that violent action against the government is sometimes justified.  As of mid-2021, Republicans are attempting to re-characterize the 6 January insurrection as a "normal tourist visit" and say [the real victims are Trump supporters getting charged with federal crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/13/great-erasure-is-now-underway-kevin-mccarthys-big-lie-confirms-it/).  

There is [another thread of Trumpist and right wing political activity](https://protectdemocracy.org/the-authoritarian-playbook/) -- introducing new laws targeting peaceful protest -- playing on the fact that U.S. legal systems bring charges against white (and Far Right) protesters at a far lower rate than against non-white protesters.  Some of these new laws add immunity from criminal and civil charges for those (assume whites) who attack these targeted protesters.  While this thread [started in 2020](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=custom&date_from=2020-01-01&date_to=2020-12-31&type=) in response to protests for racial justice , it appears to have [accellerated in 2021](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=1&type=).  This activity also parallels (*and supports*), for example, the [*no compromise* '*gun rights*' promoters](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/905820440/no-compromise-podcast-looks-at-a-far-right-gun-movement-and-its-playbook) who mix normalizing 'white-power' along with violence against non-whites, Jews, and *liberals* and effectively exploit Facebook's business model to grow and energize their ranks.  

Time and again too many American leaders (political, religious, law enforcement, and more) have ignored Trump/Trumpist signaling about the next norm-crushing moves.  [Jan 1, 2022, the NYT reacted to this situation with a plea to](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/opinion/january-6-attack-committee.html): "stop underestimating the threat facing the country. Countless times over the past six years, up to and including the events of Jan. 6, Mr. Trump and his allies openly projected their intent to do something outrageous or illegal or destructive. Every time, the common response was that they weren’t serious or that they would never succeed. How many times will we have to be proved wrong before we take it seriously?  The sooner we do, the sooner we might hope to salvage a democracy that is in grave danger."  This plea seem especially relevant given the ongoing legacy of right-wing violence and Trumpers' success at tapping into it.  

These narratives ignore the facts about terrorist activity in the U.S.  
Since the early 1990s, far right terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. outnumber those by any other group.  
There have been **more than twice as many far right attacks and plots in the U.S.** compared to far left terrorists.  
There have been **more than six and a half times more killings by far right terrorists** than attributable to far left terrorists, and the proportion of far right killings have been increasing in the last 6 years.  Far Right extremists have been [increasingly successful at marketing race-focused conspiracy theories via social media](https://hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-report-2021-10-v3.pdf) and linking them to the "*need*" for violent response.  
  
*Facts* about individual's and group's ideology are not always easily defined, especially around the edges.  Analysis of the Economist and the Center for Strategic & International Studies are both included below for contrast:

There appear to be intersections with a subset of far right violence and an important subset of those in the policing profession who "consider themselves not servants of the law, but the law itself and the law entire, above the rules, beyond accountability and answerable to no one."  "Power unrestrained serves only itself." By Leonard Pitts  [https://triblive.com/opinion/leonard-pitts-jr-power-unrestrained-serves-only-itself/](https://triblive.com/opinion/leonard-pitts-jr-power-unrestrained-serves-only-itself/).  This is NOT a condemnation of all police.  Only an observation based on living in a few different cities, reading the news for decades and recognizing that policing is a special profession where increasingly heavily armed individuals are tasked with enforcing the laws of our nation, their state and applicable 'local' mandates, while protecting 'civilians.'  And in that context, there does not seem to be sufficient success at managing who is permitted into that profession, who is promoted and who [defined by their behaviors] is retained in that profession.  Unfortunately I could find little useful data about police, policing, and far right violence.  For important issues, decision data needs to be accurate and properly contextualized.  As far as I can tell, there are no requirements that policing organizations in the U.S. report officer-involved violence to any centralized entity to support effective analysis, reporting, and more informed decision-making.  It seems like we need (for a number of reasons, not limited to far-right violence) rich, comprehensive, accurate and properly contextualized data about police and policing in the U.S.  

[Larry Pratt has been a influential force in a broad spectrum of measures across the U.S.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/larry-pratt) demanding unrestricted distribution of firearms in conjunction with establishment of a theocratic society based on what he describes as Old Testament civil and religious laws.  

When so many profit by feeding fear and outrage by generating a constant flow of misinformation via channels designed to amplify those messages, each individual's critical thinking skills -- their ability to understand and evaluate content and, at a minimum, determine truth from falsehood -- are society's last line of defense.  Support efforts to strengthen critical thinking, media literacy, and extensive exposure to *other's* perspectives especially through our schools and colleges.  We need the next generations to be better-informed citizens by better decoding *news and other messaging*.  

There appears to be a special relationship between Far Right Violence and guns (although the reverse is not evident, guns nor gun ownership cause Far Right Violence).  For fact-based information about guns and gun ownship, see: [https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/](https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/).  There is also reputable reporting that gun sales/gun ownership in the U.S. is a far more complex than my assertion might imply.  For an excellent example, see "Fearing violence and political uncertainty, Americans are buying millions more firearms" by Hannah Denham and Andrew Ba Tran [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/)  And then there is [the model](https://robertpjones.substack.com/p/free-as-f-kyle-rittenhouse-whiteness) of bringing arms to events to help incite violence, and then use that danger, one they helpte to create, to justify initiating or participating in violent behaviors.  

Strains associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may play a role in recent far right violence.  See an interesting essay -- ["In Medieval Europe, a Pandemic Changed Work Forever. Can It Happen Again?"](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/opinion/sunday/covid-plague-work-labor.html) --on this topic by M.T. Anderson.
