## Attempts to Demonize and Silence Critics of Trumpism Ignore Facts About Violence & Terrorism in U.S.  

Trump and Trumpists blame Democratic candidates, the Democratic party, Black Lives Matter, and *antifa* (*the 'radical left' in general*) for economic and broader societal problems.  Leading up to and after the November 2020 elections, they added *a vast conspiracy resulting in corruption of the popular vote*.  There is [increasing evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/us/politics/trump-right-wing-domestic-terrorism.html) that this program of misinformation was pushed into the management ranks of U.S. justice and intelligence services so that it became a systemic force to de-emphasize far right threats in favor of *finding* threats from the left.  

Trump and his surrogates employ an increasing emphasis on images of terrorism and violence they blame on liberals, Black Lives Matter, and antifa (among others) -- and 'argue' that this left wing must be ignored, silenced, and even eliminated (depending on the venue).  In their post-election rage against the popular vote, Trump and his surrogates have added [increasingly explicit references to (*sometimes* including directives to do) violence against those with whom they hold grievances](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/us/politics/republican-violent-rhetoric.html).  This activity increased in its references to explicit violence against perceived *enemies* through the 6 January 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol and beyond.  Some members of both the Senate and Congress have continued these pointed calls for *actions* against those with whom they hold grievances. As of mid-2021, Republicans are attempting to re-characterize the 6 January insurrection as a "normal tourist visit" and say [the real victims are Trump supporters getting charged with federal crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/13/great-erasure-is-now-underway-kevin-mccarthys-big-lie-confirms-it/).  

There is another thread of Trumpist and right wing political activity -- introducing new laws targeting peaceful protest -- playing on the fact that U.S. legal systems bring charges against white (and Far Right) protesters at a far lower rate than against non-white protesters.  Some of these new laws add immunity from criminal and civil charges for those (assume whites) who attack these targeted protesters.  While this thread [started in 2020](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=custom&date_from=2020-01-01&date_to=2020-12-31&type=) in response to protests for racial justice , it appears to have [accellerated in 2021](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&status=&issue=&date=1&type=).  

This narrative ignores the facts about terrorist activity in the U.S.  
Since the early 1990s, far right terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. outnumber those by any other group.  
There have been **more than twice as many far right attacks and plots in the U.S.** compared to far left terrorists.  
There have been **more than six and a half times more killings by far right terrorists** than attributable to far left terrorists, and the proportion of far right killings have been increasing in the last 6 years.  Far Right extremists have been [increasingly successful at marketing race-focused conspiracy theories via social media](https://hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-report-2021-10-v3.pdf) and linking them to the "*need*" for violent response.  
  
*Facts* about individual's and group's ideology are not always easily defined, especially around the edges.  Analysis of the Economist and the Center for Strategic & International Studies are both included below for contrast:

There appear to be intersections with a subset of far right violence and an important subset of those in the policing profession who "consider themselves not servants of the law, but the law itself and the law entire, above the rules, beyond accountability and answerable to no one."  "Power unrestrained serves only itself." By Leonard Pitts  [https://triblive.com/opinion/leonard-pitts-jr-power-unrestrained-serves-only-itself/](https://triblive.com/opinion/leonard-pitts-jr-power-unrestrained-serves-only-itself/).  This is NOT a condemnation of all police.  Only an observation based on living in a few different cities, reading the news for decades and recognizing that policing is a special profession where increasingly heavily armed individuals are tasked with enforcing the laws of our nation, their state and applicable 'local' mandates, while protecting 'civilians.'  And in that context, there does not seem to be sufficient success at managing who is permitted into that profession, who is promoted and who [defined by their behaviors] is retained in that profession.
