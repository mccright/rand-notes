Personal data made available through a data breach or through the series of data breaches that each of us have been experiencing help hostile parties who specialize in using your credit. You can resist their efforts by freezing your credit reports.  

To freeze your credit reports in North America, you must work with each of the three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.  Doing this free and does not impact your credit score.  It prevents hostile parties with from opening new lines of credit without reversing each Freeze.  

This is a powerful is preventative control.

## Review two-factor authentication options  
If you use mobile messaging as part of your strong authentication with a bank or vendor you should investigate whether they support authenticator applications.  Authenticator apps from Google and Microsoft are easy to set up and to use and they provide another layer of protection from SIM-swap attacks -- where the hostile party switches control of your phone number to a phone they have.
