NOTES:  
1. Although the Upper Level/UL was not determined for arsenic, there is no justification for adding arsenic to food or supplements.  
2. Although silicon has not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding silicon to supplements.  
3. Although vanadium in food has not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding vanadium to food and vanadium supplements should be used with caution. The Upper Level/UL is based on adverse effects in laboratory animals and this data could be used to set a UL for adults but not children and adolescents.  


This table contains the minerals that you require daily, the recommended intake of each mineral, and the highest amount of each mineral that you can intake. They are classified by essential and non-essential minerals.  


#### About Carbohydrate  
The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrate is defined as a range of intake - with a lower and upper boundary - that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients.  
The AMDR for carbohydrate is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake because its requirement is not independent of other energy fuel sources or of the total energy requirement of the individual. Thus, the AMDR is not considered a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI).  
The AMDR (as a percent of energy) for carbohydrate is 45-65% of total energy intake for children ages 1-18 and adults.  
A DRI for added sugars was not set. A maximal intake level of 25% or less of total calories from added sugars is suggested.  

#### About Fat  
The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for fat is defined as a range of intake - with a lower and upper boundary - that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients.  
The AMDR for fat is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake because its requirement is not independent of other energy fuel sources or of the total energy requirement of the individual. Thus, the AMDR is not considered a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI).  
The AMDR (as a percent of energy) for fat is 30-40% of total energy intake for children ages 1-3, 25-35% of total  energy intake for children ages 4-18, and 20-35% of total energy intake for adults.  

#### About α-Linolenic Acid  
Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) values for α-linolenic and linoleic acid are represented by an Adequate Intake (AI), which represents the lower boundary of the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR). The AIs for both α-linolenic and linoleic acid are based on the median intakes of these fatty acids in the United States.  For more information on the AMDRs for these nutrients, see [Chapter 8, "Dietary Fats: Total Fat and Fatty Acids"](https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/10) in Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients)  

#### About Linoleic Acid  
Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) values for α-linolenic and linoleic acid are represented by an Adequate Intake (AI), which represents the lower boundary of the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR). The AIs for both α-linolenic and linoleic acid are based on the median intakes of these fatty acids in the United States.  For more information on the AMDRs for these nutrients, see [Chapter 8, "Dietary Fats: Total Fat and Fatty Acids"](https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/10) in Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients)  

#### About Total Water  
Total water includes all water contained in food, beverages, and drinking water.  

#### About Vitamin E, Folate, and Niacin  
As a-tocopherol; applies to any form of supplemental a-tocopherol  
The ULs for vitamin E, niacin, and folate apply to synthetic forms obtained from supplements, fortified foods, or a combination of the two.  

#### About Carotenoids  
B-Carotene supplements are advised only to serve as a provitamin A source for individuals at risk of vitamin A deficiency.  

#### About Magnesium  
The ULs for magnesium represent intake from a pharmacological agent only and do not include intake from food and water.  

#### About Arsenic  
Although the UL was not determined for arsenic, there is no justification for adding arsenic to food or supplements.  

#### About Silicon  
Although silicon has not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding silicon to supplements.  

#### About Vanadium  
Although vanadium in food has not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding vanadium to food and vanadium supplements should be used with caution. The UL is based on adverse effects in laboratory animals and this data could be used to set a UL for adults but not children and adolescents.
