## How Can You Prepare for Retirement?

Regardless of your current age, all of us are getting older.  
At some age many of us want to stop the *grind* of daily work to generate an income -- to *retire*.  For any given individual, *retirement* may mean something different.  For most of us it will be unrecognizable from commercials showing *retirees* on sailing yachts or beach mansions.  In the United States, though, entertaining our retirement ideas will require an income stream.   

Even if we needed or wanted to continue 'working' for income, many of us will suffer physical and/or cognative decline in ways that will make doing so impractical.  
Getting realistic and explicit about financing your retirement is a topic that is easy to neglect.  Resist that path.  

Check the Social Security Administration's [Retirement Benefits Estimator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/estimator.html) to get an idea of what your *guaranteed* income stream may be.  For most, it will not be enough and you will need to cobble together additional means of retirement support over the course of your working life.  

How do you prepare for retirement?  The literature seems to suggest that establishing and periodically grooming a plan with the assistance of a formal finanical advisor works best.  Also, pick a target age for retirement to use in calculations that will test the viability of that plan.  
And start as early as you can so that the magic of compounding has lots of time to come to your aid.  
How do you know your plan is working?  Identify and then start documenting some dimensions of that plan.  Tracking Savings habits, credit card (or other high-interest) debt, emergency savings, and asset portfolio size-and-risk might be useful measures for determining the succcess of your plan.  

Your financial planner will take your information, run a set of Monte-Carlo (or other) simulations, and report on the probability of your plan and your behaviors against that plan, meeting your goal(s).  

As a reality check, you can easily review how much *annual income* a given pile of financial assets can reliably generate in these extremely low interest rate times.  If you like cash, that 2% low end it too high.  Keeping your money in cash or equivalents will deliver a lot less return than that 2%.  See the table below:

The model below is from an AARP Bulletin retelling of "The impact of Guaranteed Income and Dynamic Withdrawals on Safe Initial Withdrawal Rates" by David Blanchett, as well as my reading of the same.  

### Share of your financial resources composed of guaranteed income  

To use the table below, gather the following information:  
1. My annual guaranteed retirement income is: ________ [Social Security + any other source like an annuity or pension]  

2. My net worth is: ________ [real assets (*bank + investment balances + home equity + any-others*) minus debt (*of all types*)]  

3. My total financial resources are: ________ [Add the values in #s 1 and 2 above -- guaranteed income current value plus net worth]  

4. Calculate the share (%) of your total financial resources that is guaranteed income: ________ [divide guaranteed income by total financial resources]  

5. My percentage of spending that is nondiscretionary: ______ [spending that I cannot change - stuff like housing, health care, for some even food]  
Some portion of consumption/spending is sometimes discretionary.  In the United States, that is not the norm for every retiree.  David Blanchett argues that "Most retirees will likely have a retirement income goal that will support a combination of discretionary and nondiscretionary needs.  In other words, retirees are generally able to adjust some aspects of consumption, but not necessarily all aspects (at least without a significant degree of pain).  For example, some expenses may be relatively fixed in nature, such as housing and health care, while others can more easily be adjusted, such as entertainment and transportation, and still others may be a combination of the two, like food."  

6. Finally, find the squares on the table below at the intersection of your "Share of your financial resources composed of guaranteed income" and the percentage of your spending that is nondiscretionary.  
                                                                    % of guaranteed income of your financial resources  
                                                                          
|% nondiscretionary| 5% |25% |50% |75% | 95%|  
|:----------------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|  
|0%|2.4%|3.6%|4.4%|5.1%|6.9%|  
|25%|2.4%|3.5%|4.2%|5.0%|6.8%|  
|50%|2.4%|3.3%|4.0%|4.8%|6.6%|  
|75%|2.2%|3.1%|3.8%|4.7%|6.4%|  
|100%|2.0%|2.1%|3.6%|4.5%|6.3%|  

The *percent of guaranteed income* columns represent what David Blanchett's calculations estimate how much you can withdraw in your first year of retirement.  The annual amount is then indexed upward to match inflation.
