## Preparing for Retirement

Regardless of your current age, all of us are getting older.  

At some age many of us want to stop the *grind* of daily work to generate an income -- to [*retire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement).  For any given individual, *retirement* may mean something different.  For most of us it will be unrecognizable from commercials showing healthy *retirees* on sailing yachts or at beach mansions.  In the United States, though, entertaining our retirement ideas will require an income stream. [Note 1](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/How-can-you-prepare-for-retirement.md#NOTES)  It seems prudent to think about your quality of life in retirement.  While it may not be central to your quality of life plans, reaching a certain level of financial readiness for retirement will influence that quality of life for most of us.  Three key aspects of any retirement plan are future rates of return on retirement assets (*which almost none of us can influence*) and future wage growth rates (*again, beyond our influence at a macro-level, but we **can** influence ours at an individual level*), and how much we spend (*which we **can** influence and can have a material influence on our retirement readiness*).  

Even if we needed or wanted to continue *working* for income [*and roughly 19% of those over 65 do today*](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_labor_force_participation_rate_age_65_and_over_unadjusted), many of us will suffer physical and/or cognitive decline in ways that will make doing so impractical.  

For reference, [as of the third quarter of 2021, 50.3% of U.S. adults 55 and older, 66.9% of 65- to 74-year-olds, and 86.7% of those 75-year-olds and older said they were out of the labor force due to retirement, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the most recent official labor force data](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/04/amid-the-pandemic-a-rising-share-of-older-u-s-adults-are-now-retired/).  In 2020-2021 around 4,800 individuals in the U.S. retire every day (*one retirement every 18 seconds*).

Getting realistic and explicit about financing your retirement is a topic that is easy to neglect.  Resist that path.  Also resist the force of negativity bias -- the tendency to exaggerate negative information -- and its resulting "[behavioral tendency to overweight a narrow range of possible future events in light of incoming information](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v81n4/v81n4p1.html)," even when it is misleading or otherwise inaccurate.  

Check the Social Security Administration's [Retirement Benefits Estimator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/estimator.html) to get an idea of what your *guaranteed* income stream may be -- or use their [Quick Calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/) for an estimate, and the same for a [spouse](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html).  For most, it will not be enough to meet your wishes and you will need to cobble together additional means of retirement support over the course of your working life.  

Health care also needs to be built into your planning.  Medicare.gov has a lot of useful resources, including this summary of 2022 Medicare costs/expenses](https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11579-Medicare-Costs.pdf) and a tool to help get started finding [Medicare supplemental insurance](https://www.medicare.gov/blog/its-time-to-shop-compare-plans-for-2022).  

### How do you prepare for retirement?  

Preparing for retirement is not a race to amass huge sums of liquid assets.  It is about living your life.  But for most of us, it requires an honest reckoning with our income needs and what we might have coming from Social Security.  The Social Security Administration makes provides an easy-to-use tool to [estimate your retirement benefits at different ages and dates](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/retire-calc.html) so that you can understand the scale of that future cash flow.  If you are lucky, there may also be some employment-related retirement payments, but counting on a traditional pension is [not an option for most of us](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n3/v69n3p1.html).  Expect that you will need additional sources of income.  Try to define what that means in dollars per unit of time (*some number of dollars per month or per year*), and then begin assembling the means to generate that income stream.  

If you have the opportunity -- or if you can create the opportunity -- get a marketable college degree at an accredited non-profit college or university. (*Too many for-profit 'institutions of higher education' and 'trade schools' seem to engage in predatory business models. They seem like an unreasonable risk.*)  [Research by the U.S. Federal Reserve has shown repeatedly that](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf20.pdf): 
``` 
"Income also shows a strong positive association 
with education; in particular, income among families 
in which the reference person (i.e., *head of 
household*) has a college degree tends to be 
substantially higher than for those with less schooling. 
Mean income among college-educated familiesin the 
2019 SCF was more than twice that of families in 
any other education group." 
```
For example, the impacts in real dollars can be seen in the 4th quarter 2021 U.S. Department of Labor ["Usual Weekly Earnings Summary of Wage and Salary Workers" reported](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.nr0.htm): 
```
"full-time workers age 25 and over without a high 
school diploma had median weekly earnings of $651, 
compared with $831 for high school graduates (no college) 
and $1,467 for those holding at least a bachelor's degree. 
Among college graduates with advanced degrees (master's, 
professional, and doctoral degrees), the highest 
earning 10 percent of male workers made $4,317 or 
more per week, compared with $2,922 or more for 
their female counterparts." 
```
The relatively dramatic differences in income can make a huge difference over the 40 or more years that many of us will work.  These facts about income and educational attainment may not be indicators of causation, and your zip code at birth is still a strong indicator of future earnings and asset accumulation.  But earning a college degree still has material value for many and can open opportunities that are virtually closed to those without.  

The literature seems to suggest that establishing and periodically grooming a plan with the assistance of a formal [finanical advisor](https://www.letsmakeaplan.org/find-a-cfp-professional) works best.  Also, pick a target age for retirement to use in calculations that will test the viability of that plan over time.  
And start as early as you can so that *the magic of compounding* has enough time to come to your aid -- while remembering that:  
  * Two key aspects of any retirement plan are future rates of return on retirement assets and future wage growth rates.  Macro-trends and behaviors for both make predictions problematic.  Regardless, you, or more likely, some trusted financial resource will need to make predictions about them as foundational inputs to an analysis of your retirement plan and retirement readiness.  
  * Future gains are not guaranteed -- this is true for all types of investing.  Securities and markets go up **AND** they go down (*i.e., increase and decrease in value*).  At any given point in time, historical patterns are not always useful as illustrations of future trends.  This issue is especially true for shorter timelines.  
  * Measured risk may be an to your advantage in many contexts.  Storing *investment* money in savings accounts -- or even worse, in your home -- is not a *safe* investment strategy because of the likelihood of loss to inflation.  
  * Your behaviors can exaggerate the influence of securities price/value changes.  For example, selling at the bottom or buying at the peak prices can *lock in* losses.  I have personal experience with both and have learned that for me well-trained, experienced and mature advice helps me make better decisions.  
  * Tie your wealth-building to [money](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/opinion/cash-crypto-trust-money.html).  There are opportunities to buy *things* that have little probability of useful future value -- and that is unrelated to *investing for the future*.  *Money* in this context is an instrument that functions as a broadly agreed upon medium of exchange, and that role is socially determined. Think: "I will accept just about anything from you as payment if I trust that the next person in the chain will accept it from me."  Building wealth for retirement requires a long time, so *investment* fads that have a limited life-cycle can sap your ability to meet your retirement goals.[NOTE 2](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/How-can-you-prepare-for-retirement.md#NOTES)  
    * Accumulating *money* is a common approach to retirement planning, but there are alternative paths that work for some.  Real-estate and business ownership are two well-established ways that some accumulate family wealth that can generate a (*sometimes*) predictable income stream.  These paths are not for everyone and also require relatively sustained engagement (long-timelines) in the context of preparing for retirement.  
  * Because there are always too many self-absorbed (*cruel*) and grifters who want to take *your* money, finding a qualified and trustworthy financial advisor that is the right *fit* for you remains a bit of a challenge.  

### Remain Sufficiently Informed  

* See: "Ten Things to Consider Before You Make Investing Decisions." from the U.S. SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/tenthingstoconsider.htm](https://www.sec.gov/page/investor-section-landing)  

* Check every candidate to ensure they are trained and licensed:
  * Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)  
  * Investor Alerts and Bulletins [https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts](https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts)  

* Familiarize yourself with signs of a grifter/con-artist [https://www.businessinsider.com/7-tell-tale-signs-of-a-con-artist-2016-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/7-tell-tale-signs-of-a-con-artist-2016-3)  

* Don't casually transfer your retirement money into a financial advisor's control (or simply to where they *earn* commissions) without reading and thinking about "Questions You Should Consider Asking Before You Initiate Your Account Transfer." [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-79](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-79)  

* Think about where *your* money is going -- and make informed-enough decisions about it:  
  * Invest with your conscience fully engaged.  
  * Although "[ESG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance)" scores and comparisons are imperfect, they may be helpful, they provide context.  
  * There are screeners available to check the environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk of your investments.  One example is: [https://yoursri.com/services/services/free-services/search-compare](https://yoursri.com/services/services/free-services/search-compare)  
  * Some investments remain opaque.  It may require some effort to understand which industries and/or countries your investments support.  For example: "Investor Bulletin:  U.S.-Listed Companies Operating Chinese Businesses Through a VIE Structure." Sept. 20, 2021 [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-95](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-95)  


### Challenges Are Real -- Get Started Anyway  

I understand that not everyone on this journey starts in equal circumstances.  The [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/central.html) put the average U.S. annual net wage last year at $53,383, and the median net wage at $34,612.  That compares with the Labor Department release in May 2020 saying that [median annual gross wage earnings across all occupations](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000) was $56,310.  That suggests that many are not earning enough to make saving *easy*.  Assembling a diverse portfolio requires resources.  

Gender plays a material role in earnings in the U.S.  In late 2021 U.S. Department of Labor [outlined](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.t03.htm) gender impacts in detail.  They [summarized](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.nr0.htm) that data with: "Men's and women's earnings were closer among younger workers than older workers; for example, women ages 16 to 24 earned 94.1 percent as much as men in the same age group, while the women's-to-men's earnings ratio was 76.9 percent for those age 55 and over."  

In addition, non-whites in the U.S. face systemic economic pressures that are material to any discussion about retirement planning.  4th quarter 2021 U.S. Department of Labor [reported](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.nr0.htm) that "median weekly earnings of Blacks ($805) and Hispanics ($799) working full-time jobs were lower than those of Whites ($1,030) and Asians ($1,384)."  Those differences impact wealth accumulation.  In 2019 The Federal Reserve published a paper outlining [disparities in wealth by race and ethnicity](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm) -- showing that there are sizeable differences in wealth by race and ethnicity, most starkly between young Black and young White families:  
```
The median young Black family has almost no wealth ($600). 
In contrast, the median young White family has a wealth of $25,400. 
Young Hispanic and other families fall in between, 
with $11,200 and $13,500 in median wealth, respectively.  
```
Changing that racial disparity, which is real and is a slice of broader long-running racism, is critically important, but is beyond the scope of this argument.  

A [recent Federal Reserve paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018080pap.pdf) documented that a very different constellation of circumstances is associated with "[millennials](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/Generations-Defined.md) own(ing) fewer assets than members of earlier generations" when they were young, with lower earnings, fewer assets, and less wealth.  

The most recent [Federal Reserve data](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) says that only 54.5 percent of Americans ages 55 to 64 have retirement accounts.  

If you find yourself a decade or more behind your peers -- or if you just fear it -- the foundational rule is to get started on a path to some type, some level of *retirement readiness.*  

Regardless of the scale of your available resources, the most important short term priority is to start building wealth.  How much wealth?  That will vary, but a commonly-repeated target remains "you need 25-times your pre-tax income portfolio goal when you retire" ([*here quoted from David M. Blanchett, Ph.D., CFA, CFP®, and more*](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2021/02/25/retirement-planning-in-the-post-4-world))," which I believe for most can safely be simplified to "your retirement investment portfolio should be 25 times the size of your annual income at retirement."  For most of us that can seem like a challenge, but try to remain engaged in your efforts to prepare for your retirement -- don't freeze up.  Research your options -- there are lots of on-line resources.  A very quick, crude, retirement savings calculator is available at: [https://www.cnn.com/business/calculators/retirement-calculator](https://www.cnn.com/business/calculators/retirement-calculator).  Make decision after decision.  Take the next step, and the next.  Here is an example of what 20 and 25-times some sample annual incomes looks like:  

|Annual Income|Times 20|Times 25|
|:-----------:|:------:|:------:|
|$20,000 | $400,000 | $500,000|
|$30,000 | $600,000 | $750,000|
|$40,000 | $800,000 | $1,000,000|
|$50,000 | $1,000,000 | $1,250,000|
|$60,000 | $1,200,000 | $1,500,000|
|$70,000 | $1,400,000 | $1,750,000|
|$80,000 | $1,600,000 | $2,000,000|
|$90,000 | $1,800,000 | $2,250,000|
|$100,000 | $2,000,000 | $2,500,000|
|$110,000 | $2,200,000 | $2,750,000|
|$120,000 | $2,400,000 | $3,000,000|
|$130,000 | $2,600,000 | $3,250,000|
|$140,000 | $2,800,000 | $3,500,000|
|$150,000 | $3,000,000 | $3,750,000|

Again, these numbers can seem like a challenge in isolation.  But for many who reach them, they are the result of regular *savings* for retirement and full participation in employer plans over many years.  One of the keys is to start and stick with a plan.  

For many, a material component of your retirement readiness equation is your spending behaviors.  Be mindful, self-aware and alert.  Ask yourself, "Am I doing the right thing?"  This is especially true for your 'consumer' behaviors.  For a lot of us, asset accumulation also meant deciding how **not** to spend our money.  If you can look at your own actions from the perspective of a third party who cares about meeting your retirement goals, you may be able to make choices better aligned with your retirement *asset accumulation* goals.  

Also, a number of wise peers have counseled me to remember that it’s never too late to learn, and asking a question is often more important than knowing the answer.  [Thank you Pranav Doctor.](https://blog.avenuecode.com/ac-spotlight-pranava-doctor)  

There will be some uncertainty.  It is not unusual to find your inner voice asking: "How did I end up here?" or "What am I doing with my investments?" or even "Why did I ever agree to this?"  There is no magic for dealing with these issues.  Talk with people you trust.  Learn about your options for managing your money, saving and investing.  And, as needed, adapt.  

There are some useful tools and information at: SEC Investor.gov Publications and Research (includes financial tools and calculators) [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/publications-and-research](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/publications-and-research).  

How do you know your plan is working?  Identify and then start documenting some dimensions of that plan.  Tracking Savings habits, credit card (or other high-interest) debt, emergency savings, and asset portfolio size-and-risk might be useful measures for determining the succcess of your plan.  

Your financial planner will take your information, run a set of Monte-Carlo (or other) simulations, and report on the probability of your plan and your behaviors against that plan, meeting your goal(s) that define your successful financial outcome(s) at an older age.  

When you approach or enter *retirement,* your willingness to assume risks in equity, commodity, or other markets may evaporate [*this might be changing*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/business/retirement-stocks-vanguard.html).  It is a challenge, though, to generate an income stream using only the safest of financial instruments (cash, or near-cash equivalents).  Safety does not pay today -- you may receive less than one half of one percent interest in your local bank.  As a reality check, you can easily review how much *annual income* a given pile of financial assets can reliably generate in these extremely low interest rate times.  *Storing* your money in cash or equivalents will generally deliver stability, but with a relatively low return.  See the table below:  

|Assets| 1.0% | 1.25%| 1.5% | 1.75%| 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% | 3.5% | 4.0% | 4.5% | 5.0% | 5.5% | 6.0% |

Some individuals and families have retirement cash flow expectations of $150,000/yr, $200,000/yr, even $300,000/yr.  I included some *big* numbers in the Assets column to help demonstrate the scale of preparation required to support income streams like that.  I read that too often, individuals spending at these levels in retirement have not constructed the required financial foundation, and burn through material portions of their retirement funds before aknowledging that situation -- leaving them seriously financially challenged for the duration of their life.  Not where any of us want to land.  

Those upper rows refer to material wealth.  Who has that kind of money?  Most don't.  [Over the past 40 years wages have stagnated against the cost of living for most Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/).  And the proportion of the U.S. population who have accumulated $1.2 million or more has shrunk and the distance between the median wealth and entry into the top 9.9% has more than doubled in the last 6 decades.   
In “The 9.9 Percent,” Matthew Stewart noted that in 1963, the median household would have needed 10 times as much wealth to reach the middle of the (*top*) 9.9 percent. Today, it would need 24 times as much wealth. 
He also reported that it took $2.4 million in assets to reach the the 9.9 percent group's median...  
Quoted from a review by Eyal Press: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/books/review/the-99-percent-matthew-stewart.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/books/review/the-99-percent-matthew-stewart.html)  The U.S. Federal Reserve reports](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:0;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:1,5,7;units:shares;range:1989.3,2021.3) that the top 1% of of Americans by accumulated wealth own over a third of all wealth in the country (roughly the same amount as the bottom 90%), while the bottom 50% own about 2.5% of all wealth.  Those are just facts.  They document the distribution of wealth -- that by almost any measure seems unfair.  They do not, though, alter the ruthless impacts of time and aging that require planning for *old age* and whatever will be your retirement.  

Once you *retire* and begin drawing from your accumulated assets, it is also important to consider the tax of your various options.  Withdrawals from defined-contribution plans like some types of IRAs and 401(k)s are taxable on at your federal level, based on your income.  Withdrawals from an Roth IRA is not taxable if you are at least 59 1/2, as long as you have kept the money in the Roth IRA account for at least five years.


The model below is from an AARP Bulletin retelling of "The impact of Guaranteed Income and Dynamic Withdrawals on Safe Initial Withdrawal Rates" by David Blanchett, as well as my reading of the same.  

### Share of your financial resources composed of guaranteed income  

To use the table below, gather the following information:  
1. My annual guaranteed retirement income is: ________ [Social Security + any other source like an annuity or pension]  

2. My net worth is: ________ [real assets (*bank + investment balances + home equity + any-others*) minus debt (*of all types*)]  

3. My total financial resources are: ________ [Add the values in #s 1 and 2 above -- guaranteed income current value plus net worth]  

4. Calculate the share (%) of your total financial resources that is guaranteed income: ________ [divide guaranteed income by total financial resources]  

5. My percentage of spending that is nondiscretionary: ______ [spending that I cannot change - stuff like housing, health care, for some even food]  
Some portion of consumption/spending is sometimes discretionary.  In the United States, that is not the norm for every retiree.  David Blanchett argues that "Most retirees will likely have a retirement income goal that will support a combination of discretionary and nondiscretionary needs.  In other words, retirees are generally able to adjust some aspects of consumption, but not necessarily all aspects (at least without a significant degree of pain).  For example, some expenses may be relatively fixed in nature, such as housing and health care, while others can more easily be adjusted, such as entertainment and transportation, and still others may be a combination of the two, like food."  

6. Finally, find the squares on the table below at the intersection of your "Share of your financial resources composed of guaranteed income" and the percentage of your spending that is nondiscretionary.  
                                                                    % of guaranteed income of your financial resources  
                                                                          
|% nondiscretionary| 5% |25% |50% |75% | 95%|  
|:----------------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|  
|0%|2.4%|3.6%|4.4%|5.1%|6.9%|  
|25%|2.4%|3.5%|4.2%|5.0%|6.8%|  
|50%|2.4%|3.3%|4.0%|4.8%|6.6%|  
|75%|2.2%|3.1%|3.8%|4.7%|6.4%|  
|100%|2.0%|2.1%|3.6%|4.5%|6.3%|  

The *percent of guaranteed income* columns represent what David Blanchett's calculations estimate how much you can withdraw in your first year of retirement.  The annual amount is then indexed upward to match inflation.

#### NOTES  
**Note 1**:  Unfortunately, planning for and building a formal retirement plan is an unattainable luxury for too many people in the United States.  [In 2019 families with the lowest 25% of net worths in the U.S.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf20.pdf)[page 10], had a median (the middle value in the data set) income of $29,900, and mean (average) income of $37,900 -- leaving little *excess* for saving/investing.  [Systemic and cultural barriers constrain opportunities for some](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm), especially those most impacted by America's original sin of slavery.  I understand some of these abstract facts but don't understand the nature and scope of societal evolution that could eliminate this curse.  
**Note 2**: Cryptocurrency (crypto), a large, evolving universe decentralized digital currencies and infrastructure, seems misaligned with **most** of our retirement wealth accumulation and income generation needs.  Cryptocurrencies play a material role in criminal activity across the globe.  Cryptocurrency exchanges tend to resist participation in '*know your customer*' and other crime-resisting measures.  More than a few cryptocurrency exchanges have suffered large-scale losses.  Cryptocurrency mining and use of underlying blockchain technology for *recorkeeping* seem excessively energy consumptive (i.e., *environmentally destructive*).  The lifecycles of some cryptocurrencies have appeared to be little more than unregulated pump-and-dump, digital grifter schemes.  [Paul Krugman argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/opinion/cryptocurrency-subprime-vulnerable.html) that "there’s growing evidence that the risks of crypto are falling disproportionately on people who don’t know what they are getting into and are poorly positioned to handle the downside."  I recognize that cryptocurrencies have generated returns for some, but that I believe it would be an investment mistake to draw too many parallels with more traditional forms of investing and units of wealth accumulation.  As of EoY 2021, I do not view cryptocurrency as a **material** component in any risk-reasonable retirement portfolio (except for those who maintain large-scale multi-generational wealth, where it may have a place in their diversification program).  See: [https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-are-legal-risks-cryptocurrency-investors/](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-are-legal-risks-cryptocurrency-investors/), [https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/cryptocurrency-risks-to-your-institution-and-the-regulatory-landscape/](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/cryptocurrency-risks-to-your-institution-and-the-regulatory-landscape/), and *a little dated* [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dantedisparte/2018/07/21/beware-of-crypto-risks-10-risks-to-watch/?sh=1b5fd7d5f17f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dantedisparte/2018/07/21/beware-of-crypto-risks-10-risks-to-watch/?sh=1b5fd7d5f17f).  
Also, in the context of the Russian (*Putin's*) war to crush Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, and annex Ukraine's territory as it's own [some *boosters* are highlighting cryptocurrency as a tool for sanctions-dodgers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/06/russia-ukraine-war-news-putin-live-updates/#link-DMXOOTU5YBAGJK7LEP676M4VVY) -- which seems like a useful real-world example of a mis-use case.  This is **real** war of aggression -- doing what this type of agression has always done, industrial-scale murder, destruction of physical and operational infrastructure, along with destruction of industrial, agricultural, and social governance capacity, and individual human and collective suffering on a national scale -- laying waste to a democratic nation of 43 million people.  Highlighting cryptocurrencies as a way to support portions of the Russian war-time economy (*while generating profits for cryptocurrency insiders*) is by any measure not something for *normal* economic market participants or for supporters of democracy and human decency.
