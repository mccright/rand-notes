## How Can You Prepare for Retirement?

Regardless of your current age, all of us are getting older.  
At some age many of us want to stop the *grind* of daily work to generate an income -- to *retire*.  For any given individual, *retirement* may mean something different.  For most of us it will be unrecognizable from commercials showing *retirees* on sailing yachts or at beach mansions.  In the United States, though, entertaining our retirement ideas will require an income stream.   

Even if we needed or wanted to continue 'working' for income, many of us will suffer physical and/or cognative decline in ways that will make doing so impractical.  
Getting realistic and explicit about financing your retirement is a topic that is easy to neglect.  Resist that path.  

Check the Social Security Administration's [Retirement Benefits Estimator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/estimator.html) to get an idea of what your *guaranteed* income stream may be -- or use their [Quick Calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/) for an estimate.  For most, it will not be enough to meet your wishes and you will need to cobble together additional means of retirement support over the course of your working life.  

How do you prepare for retirement?  

The literature seems to suggest that establishing and periodically grooming a plan with the assistance of a formal finanical advisor works best.  Also, pick a target age for retirement to use in calculations that will test the viability of that plan over time.  
And start as early as you can so that *the magic of compounding* has enough time to come to your aid -- while remembering that:  
  * Future gains are not guaranteed -- this is true for all types of investing.  Securities and markets go up AND they go down (*i.e., increase and decrease in value*).  At any given point in time, historical patterns are not always useful as illustrations of future trends.  This issue is especially true for shorter timelines.  
  * Measured risk may be an to your advantage in many contexts.  Storing *investment* money in savings accounts -- or even worse, in your home -- is not a *safe* investment strategy because of the likelihood of loss to inflation.  
  * Your behaviors can exaggerate the influence of securities price/value changes.  For example, selling at the bottom or buying at the peak prices can *lock in* losses.  I have a little experience with both and have learned that for me well-trained, experienced and mature advice helps me make better decisions.  
  * Because there are always jerks and grifters who want to take your money, finding a qualified and trustworthy financial advisor that is the right *fit* for you remains a bit of a challenge.

* See: "Ten Things to Consider Before You Make Investing Decisions." from the U.S. SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/tenthingstoconsider.htm](https://www.sec.gov/page/investor-section-landing)  

* Check every candidate to ensure they are trained and licensed:
  * Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)  
  * Investor Alerts and Bulletins [https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts](https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts)  

* Familiarize yourself with signs of a grifter/con-artist [https://www.businessinsider.com/7-tell-tale-signs-of-a-con-artist-2016-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/7-tell-tale-signs-of-a-con-artist-2016-3)  

* Don't casually transfer your retirement money toward a financial advisor's control (or simply to where they *earn* commissions) without reading and thinking about "Questions You Should Consider Asking Before You Initiate Your Account Transfer." [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-79](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-79)  

* Think about where *your* money is going -- and make informed-enough decisions about it:  
  * Invest with your conscience fully engaged.  
  * Although "[ESG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance)" scores and comparisons are imperfect, they may be helpful, they provide context.  
  * There are screeners available to check the environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk of your investments.  One example is: [https://yoursri.com/services/services/free-services/search-compare](https://yoursri.com/services/services/free-services/search-compare)  
  * Some investments remain opaque.  It may require some effort to understand which industries and/or countries your investments support.  For example: "Investor Bulletin:  U.S.-Listed Companies Operating Chinese Businesses Through a VIE Structure." Sept. 20, 2021 [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-95](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-95)  

I understand that not everyone on this journey starts in equal circumstances.  Assembling a diverse portfolio requires resources.  In 2019 The Federal Reserve published a paper outlining [disparities in wealth by race and ethnicity](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm) -- showing that there are sizeable differences in wealth by race and ethnicity, most starkly between young Black and young White families:  
```
The median young Black family has almost no wealth ($600). 
In contrast, the median young White family has a wealth of $25,400. 
Young Hispanic and other families fall in between, 
with $11,200 and $13,500 in median wealth, respectively.  
```

Changing that racial disparity, which is real and is a slice of broader long-running racism, is critically important, but is beyond the scope of this argument.  

A [recent Federal Reserve paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018080pap.pdf) documented that a very different constellation of circumstances is associated with "[millennials](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/Generations-Defined.md) own(ing) fewer assets than members of earlier generations" when they were young, with lower earnings, fewer assets, and less wealth.  

The most recent [Federal Reserve data](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) says that only 54.5 percent of Americans ages 55 to 64 have retirement accounts.  

If you find yourself a decade or more behind your peers -- or if you just fear it -- the foundational rule is to get started on a path to some type, some level of *retirement readiness.*  

Regardless of the scale of your available resources, the most important short term priority is to start building wealth.  How much wealth?  That will vary, but a commonly-repeated target remains "[you need 25-times your pre-tax portfolio income goal when you retire](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2021/02/25/retirement-planning-in-the-post-4-world)," which I believe for most can safely be simplified to "25 times your income at retirement."  For most of us that can seem like a challenge, but try to remain engaged in your efforts to prepare for your retirement -- don't freeze up.  Research your options -- there are lots of on-line resources.  Make decision after decision.  Take the next step, and the next.  

There are some useful tools and information at: SEC Investor.gov Publications and Research (includes financial tools and calculators) [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/publications-and-research](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/publications-and-research)  

How do you know your plan is working?  Identify and then start documenting some dimensions of that plan.  Tracking Savings habits, credit card (or other high-interest) debt, emergency savings, and asset portfolio size-and-risk might be useful measures for determining the succcess of your plan.  

Your financial planner will take your information, run a set of Monte-Carlo (or other) simulations, and report on the probability of your plan and your behaviors against that plan, meeting your goal(s).  

When you approach or enter *retirement,* your willingness to assume risks in equity, commodity, or other markets may evaporate.  It is a challenge, though, to generate an income stream using only the safest of financial instruments (cash, or near-cash equivalents).  Safety does not pay today -- you may receive less than one half of one percent interest in your local bank.  As a reality check, you can easily review how much *annual income* a given pile of financial assets can reliably generate in these extremely low interest rate times.  If you like cash, that 2% low end is far too high.  Storing your money in cash or equivalents will deliver a lot less return than that 2%.  See the table below:

Some individuals and families have retirement cash flow expectations of $150,000/yr, $200,000/yr, even $300,000/yr.  I included some *big* numbers in the Assets column to help demonstrate the scale of preparation required to support income streams like that.  I read that too often, individuals spending at these levels in retirement have not constructed the required financial foundation, and burn through material portions of their retirement funds before aknowledging that situation -- leaving them seriously financially challenged for the duration of their life.  Not where any of us want to land.  

The model below is from an AARP Bulletin retelling of "The impact of Guaranteed Income and Dynamic Withdrawals on Safe Initial Withdrawal Rates" by David Blanchett, as well as my reading of the same.  

Those upper rows refer to material wealth.  Who has that kind of money?  Most don't.  
    In “The 9.9 Percent,” Matthew Stewart noted that in 1963, the median household would have needed 10 times as much wealth to reach the middle of the 9.9 percent. Today, it would need 24 times as much wealth.
    He also reported that the 9.9 percent group started with a minimum of $1.2 million in assets...  
    Quoted from a review by Eyal Press: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/books/review/the-99-percent-matthew-stewart.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/books/review/the-99-percent-matthew-stewart.html)  

Preparing for retirement is not a race to amass huge sums of liquid assets.  But for most of us, it requires an honest reckoning with our income needs and what we might have coming from Social Security -- and if you are lucky, some employment-related retirement payments.  Expect that you will need additional sources of income.  Try to define what that means in dollars per unit of time, and then begin assembling the means to generate that income stream.

### Share of your financial resources composed of guaranteed income  

To use the table below, gather the following information:  
1. My annual guaranteed retirement income is: ________ [Social Security + any other source like an annuity or pension]  

2. My net worth is: ________ [real assets (*bank + investment balances + home equity + any-others*) minus debt (*of all types*)]  

3. My total financial resources are: ________ [Add the values in #s 1 and 2 above -- guaranteed income current value plus net worth]  

4. Calculate the share (%) of your total financial resources that is guaranteed income: ________ [divide guaranteed income by total financial resources]  

5. My percentage of spending that is nondiscretionary: ______ [spending that I cannot change - stuff like housing, health care, for some even food]  
Some portion of consumption/spending is sometimes discretionary.  In the United States, that is not the norm for every retiree.  David Blanchett argues that "Most retirees will likely have a retirement income goal that will support a combination of discretionary and nondiscretionary needs.  In other words, retirees are generally able to adjust some aspects of consumption, but not necessarily all aspects (at least without a significant degree of pain).  For example, some expenses may be relatively fixed in nature, such as housing and health care, while others can more easily be adjusted, such as entertainment and transportation, and still others may be a combination of the two, like food."  

6. Finally, find the squares on the table below at the intersection of your "Share of your financial resources composed of guaranteed income" and the percentage of your spending that is nondiscretionary.  
                                                                    % of guaranteed income of your financial resources  
                                                                          
|% nondiscretionary| 5% |25% |50% |75% | 95%|  
|:----------------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|  
|0%|2.4%|3.6%|4.4%|5.1%|6.9%|  
|25%|2.4%|3.5%|4.2%|5.0%|6.8%|  
|50%|2.4%|3.3%|4.0%|4.8%|6.6%|  
|75%|2.2%|3.1%|3.8%|4.7%|6.4%|  
|100%|2.0%|2.1%|3.6%|4.5%|6.3%|  

The *percent of guaranteed income* columns represent what David Blanchett's calculations estimate how much you can withdraw in your first year of retirement.  The annual amount is then indexed upward to match inflation.
