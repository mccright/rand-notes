## Preparing for Retirement

Regardless of your current age, all of us are getting older.  

At some age many of us want to escape [hustle culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html) and stop the *grind* of daily work to generate an income -- to [*retire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement).  For any given individual, *retirement* may mean something different.  For most of us it will be unrecognizable from commercials showing healthy *retirees* on sailing yachts or at beach mansions.  In the United States, though, entertaining our retirement ideas will require an income stream. [Note 1](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/How-can-you-prepare-for-retirement.md#NOTES)  It seems prudent to think about your quality of life in retirement.  While it may not be central to your quality of life plans, reaching a certain level of financial readiness for retirement will influence that quality of life for most of us.  Four key aspects of any retirement plan are [1] when, where and how much we invest (*which we **can** influence and can have a material influence on our retirement readiness*), [2] future rates of return on retirement assets (*which almost none of us can influence*), [3] future wage growth rates (*again, beyond our influence at a macro-level, but we **can** influence ours at an individual level*), and [4] how much we spend (*which we **can** influence and can also have a material influence on our retirement readiness*).  

Even if we needed or wanted to continue *working* for income [*and roughly 19% of those over 65 do today*](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_labor_force_participation_rate_age_65_and_over_unadjusted), many of us will suffer physical and/or cognitive decline in ways that will make doing so impractical.  

For reference, [as of the third quarter of 2021, 50.3% of U.S. adults 55 and older, 66.9% of 65- to 74-year-olds, and 86.7% of those 75-year-olds and older said they were out of the labor force due to retirement, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the most recent official labor force data](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/04/amid-the-pandemic-a-rising-share-of-older-u-s-adults-are-now-retired/).  In 2020-2021 around 4,800 individuals in the U.S. retired every day (*one retirement every 18 seconds*).  

For almost all of us, preparing for retirement is an integral part of our work-life.  If you have some employer-sponsored or employer-assisted retirement investing options, use them.  
Traditional pension plans -- often called *defined contribution plans* -- are rare.  These plans required employers to assume the investment risks required to pay retiree benefits.  In the U.S. employers are no longer willing to take on those risks.  Traditional pension plans have been all but replaced by 401(k) plans (*and related 40x(x)* plans) -- which are often called *defined contribution plans*.  Unlike traditional pensions, these plans will pay you nothing unless you invest in them. Essentially, the current U.S. retirement system is pushing working people to become investors and to assume all the associated risks.  

Getting realistic and explicit about financing your retirement is a topic that is easy to neglect.  Resist that path.  Also resist the force of negativity bias -- the tendency to exaggerate negative information -- and its resulting "[behavioral tendency to overweight a narrow range of possible future events in light of incoming information](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v81n4/v81n4p1.html)," even when it is misleading or otherwise inaccurate.  Some behaviors may be generational - [Fidelity reported](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/about-fidelity/FID-SORP-DataSheet.pdf) that 45% of NextGen "don't see a point in saving until things return to normal."  

If you're thinking about preparing for retirement, assume that you will never have everything lined up or figured out perfectly before you start.  Things change.  Constantly.  As is true for virtually any activity that requires you to invest over time, the *secret* to creating lasting momentum is to **start now** and **evolve later**.  Let time be your ally.  

If you have not already done so, check the Social Security Administration's [Retirement Benefits Estimator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/estimator.html) to get an idea of what your *guaranteed* income stream may be -- or use their [Quick Calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/) for an estimate, and the same for a [spouse](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html).  For most, it will not be enough to meet your wishes and you will need to cobble together additional means of retirement support over the course of your working life.  

Health care also needs to be built into your planning.  Medicare.gov has a lot of useful resources, including this summary of 2022 Medicare costs/expenses](https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11579-Medicare-Costs.pdf) and a tool to help get started finding [Medicare supplemental insurance](https://www.medicare.gov/blog/its-time-to-shop-compare-plans-for-2022).  

### How do you prepare for retirement?  

Preparing for retirement is not a race to amass huge sums of liquid assets.  It is about living your life.  But for most of us, it requires an honest reckoning with our income needs and what we might have coming from Social Security.  The Social Security Administration makes provides an easy-to-use tool to [estimate your retirement benefits at different ages and dates](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/retire-calc.html) so that you can understand the scale of that future cash flow.  For context, as of Summer 2022, the [Social Security Administration reports](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2022.pdf) that the average monthly Social Security retirement check in 2022 is $1,657, and that [the maximum possible benefit](https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-01897) at Full Retirement Age would be $3,345 (or $4,194 if you retire at age 70 in 2022).  If you are lucky, there may also be some employment-related retirement payments, but counting on a traditional pension is [not an option for most of us](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n3/v69n3p1.html).  Expect that you will need additional sources of income.  Try to define what that means in dollars per unit of time (*some number of dollars per month or per year*), and then begin assembling the means to generate that income stream.  

If you have any type(s) of *employer match* components of a *defined contribution plan* use them.  If possible, invest enough to get 100% of the *employer match*.  Those *matching* dollars are a critically important component of your overall employment benefits.  It is impossible to exaggerate their importance in your retirement preparations.  If you do not have this type of employer benefit, you still need to prepare for the future.  If you are still young, [10% is a commonly advised savings goal](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/business/bear-market-retirement-investment.html) and [15% is probably more appropriate for many](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/17/first-job-money-management/), but [the most important consideration is getting into the habit of saving](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/17/first-job-money-management/), so if you can't do 10% yet, start with 3% or 5% -- the critical thing is to start.  

#### Formal Education Appears to Help  
If you have the opportunity -- or if you can create the opportunity -- get a marketable college degree at an accredited non-profit college or university. (*Too many for-profit 'institutions of higher education' and 'trade schools' seem to engage in predatory business models. They seem like an unreasonable risk.*)  [Research by the U.S. Federal Reserve has shown repeatedly that](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf20.pdf): 
>"Income also shows a strong positive association with education; in particular, income among families in which the reference person (i.e., *head of household*) has a college degree tends to be substantially higher than for those with less schooling.  Mean income among college-educated families in the 2019 SCF was more than twice that of families in any other education group."  

For example, the impacts in real dollars can be seen in the 4th quarter 2021 U.S. Department of Labor ["Usual Weekly Earnings Summary of Wage and Salary Workers" reported](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.nr0.htm): 
> "full-time workers age 25 and over without a high school diploma had median weekly earnings of $651, compared with $831 for high school graduates (no college) and $1,467 for those holding at least a bachelor's degree. Among college graduates with advanced degrees (master's, professional, and doctoral degrees), the highest earning 10 percent of male workers made $4,317 or more per week, compared with $2,922 or more for their female counterparts."  

Similarly, [Auerbach, Kotlikoff and Koehler](https://kotlikoff.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/U.S.-Inequality-and-Fiscal-Progessivity-JPE-7-5-22.pdf) report in July 2022 that:  
>studies by Goldin and Katz (2008) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011) show a steady and dramatic 75 percent increase in the college/high school wage premium over the last three decades, with typical college graduate wages now double that of high school graduates.  

The relatively dramatic differences in income can make a huge difference over the 40 or more years that many of us will work.  These facts about income and educational attainment may not be indicators of causation, [educational inequality](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29979/w29979.pdf) is real, and your zip code at birth is still a strong indicator of future earnings and asset accumulation.  But earning a college degree still has material value for many and can open opportunities that are virtually closed to those without.  

#### Building a Plan Helps  
The literature seems to suggest that establishing and periodically grooming a plan with the assistance of a formal [finanical advisor](https://www.letsmakeaplan.org/find-a-cfp-professional) works best.  Also, pick a target age for retirement to use in calculations that will test the viability of that plan over time.  
And start as early as you can so that *the magic of compounding* has enough time to come to your aid -- while remembering that:  
  * Two key aspects of any retirement plan are future rates of return on retirement assets and future wage growth rates.  Macro-trends and behaviors for both make predictions problematic.  Regardless, you, or more likely, some trusted financial resource will need to make predictions about them as foundational inputs to an analysis of your retirement plan and retirement readiness.  
  * Future gains are not guaranteed -- this is true for all types of investing.  Securities and markets go up **AND** they go down (*i.e., increase and decrease in value --  here are a couple illustrations of how average [401(k)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wPerFin401k082222-1024x579.jpg) and [IRA](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wPerFinIRA082222-1024x578.jpg) account values have trended up, with some significant downturns over time.*).  Investing in stocks and equity index or mutual funds will require you tolerate some volatility.  While even the best financial advisor will take [reasonable care](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-240/subject-group-ECFR64f52d737aea1ed/section-240.15l-1) in developing and making recommendations, investing in securities involves risk, and you may lose money.  In extreme cases losses may include your entire investment capital -- *but a foundational component of your planning involves building a savings/investment portfolio that resists extreme loss*.  At any given point in time, historical patterns are not always useful as illustrations of future trends.  This issue is especially true for shorter timelines.  Approach risk-taking seriously.  
  * Measured risk may be an to your advantage in many contexts.  Storing *investment* money in savings accounts -- or even worse, in your home -- is not a *safe* **investment strategy** because of the likelihood of loss to inflation.  
  * Your behaviors can exaggerate the influence of securities price/value changes.  For example, selling at the bottom or buying at the peak prices can *lock in* losses.  I have personal experience with both and have learned that for me well-trained, experienced and mature advice helps me make better decisions.  
    * It is also possible to take advantage of the influence of securities price/value changes.  [Jeff Sommer](https://twitter.com/jeffsommer), New York Times columnist on markets, finance and the economy wrote useful essays on how -- *as part of a program of [dollar-cost-averaging](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/dollar-cost-averaging)* -- [investing during bear markets](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/business/bear-market-retirement-investment.html) and [recessions](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/business/investing-inflation-recession.html) may bring enhanced rewards].  A simplistic version of this idea involves [buying the whole market and holding on to those investments](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/business/stock-market-bear-nothing.html).  
  * Tie your wealth-building to [money](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/opinion/cash-crypto-trust-money.html).  There are opportunities to buy *things* that have little probability of useful future value -- and that is unrelated to *investing for the future*.  *Money* in this context is an instrument that functions as a broadly agreed upon medium of exchange, and that role is socially determined. Think: "I will accept just about anything from you as payment if I trust that the next person in the chain will accept it from me."  For most, building wealth for retirement requires a long time, so *investment* fads that have a limited life-cycle can sap your ability to meet your retirement goals.[NOTE 2](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/How-can-you-prepare-for-retirement.md#NOTES)  
    * Accumulating *money* is a common approach to retirement planning, but there are alternative paths that work for some.  Real-estate and business ownership are two well-established ways that some accumulate family wealth that can generate a (*sometimes*) predictable income stream.  These paths are not for everyone and also require relatively sustained engagement (long-timelines) in the context of preparing for retirement.  
  * Because there are always too many self-absorbed (*cruel*) *advisors*/*coaches* and grifters who want to take *your* money, finding a qualified and trustworthy financial advisor that is the right *fit* for you remains a bit of a challenge.[NOTE 3](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/How-can-you-prepare-for-retirement.md#NOTES)   

### Remain Sufficiently Informed  

* See: "Ten Things to Consider Before You Make Investing Decisions." from the U.S. SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/tenthingstoconsider.htm](https://www.sec.gov/page/investor-section-landing)  

* Check every candidate to ensure they are trained and licensed:
  * Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)  
  * Investor Alerts and Bulletins [https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts](https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts)  

* Familiarize yourself with signs of a grifter/con-artist [https://www.businessinsider.com/7-tell-tale-signs-of-a-con-artist-2016-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/7-tell-tale-signs-of-a-con-artist-2016-3)  

* Don't casually transfer your retirement money into a financial advisor's control (or simply to where they *earn* commissions) without reading and thinking about "Questions You Should Consider Asking Before You Initiate Your Account Transfer." [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-79](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-79)  

* Think about where *your* money is going -- and make informed-enough decisions about it:  
  * Invest with your conscience fully engaged.  
  * Although "[ESG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance)" scores and comparisons are imperfect, they may be helpful, they provide context.  
  * There are screeners available to check the environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk of your investments.  One example is: [https://yoursri.com/services/services/free-services/search-compare](https://yoursri.com/services/services/free-services/search-compare)  
  * Some investments remain opaque.  It may require some effort to understand which industries and/or countries your investments support.  For example: "Investor Bulletin:  U.S.-Listed Companies Operating Chinese Businesses Through a VIE Structure." Sept. 20, 2021 [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-95](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-95)  


### Challenges Are Real -- Get Started Anyway  

I understand that not everyone on this journey starts in equal circumstances.  The [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/central.html) put the average U.S. annual net wage last year at $53,383, and the median net wage at $34,612.  That compares with the Labor Department release in May 2020 saying that [median annual gross wage earnings across all occupations](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000) was $56,310.  That suggests that many are not earning enough to make saving *easy*.  Assembling a diverse portfolio requires resources.  

Gender plays a material role in earnings in the U.S.  In late 2021 U.S. Department of Labor [outlined](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.t03.htm) gender impacts in detail.  They [summarized](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.nr0.htm) that data with: "Men's and women's earnings were closer among younger workers than older workers; for example, women ages 16 to 24 earned 94.1 percent as much as men in the same age group, while the women's-to-men's earnings ratio was 76.9 percent for those age 55 and over."  

In addition, non-whites in the U.S. face systemic economic pressures that are material to any discussion about retirement planning.  4th quarter 2021 U.S. Department of Labor [reported](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.nr0.htm) that "median weekly earnings of Blacks ($805) and Hispanics ($799) working full-time jobs were lower than those of Whites ($1,030) and Asians ($1,384)."  Those differences impact wealth accumulation.  In 2019 The Federal Reserve published a paper outlining [disparities in wealth by race and ethnicity](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm) -- showing that there are sizeable differences in wealth by race and ethnicity, most starkly between young Black and young White families:  
```
The median young Black family has almost no wealth ($600). 
In contrast, the median young White family has a wealth of $25,400. 
Young Hispanic and other families fall in between, 
with $11,200 and $13,500 in median wealth, respectively.  
```

There are other systemic, race-relevant wealth-accumulation issues as well.  [Research from the St. Louis Fed.](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2022/may/single-mothers-slim-financial-cushions) documented that many single mothers have very low levels of financial reserves.  "Among singles (i.e., those who have never married, are divorced, widowed or separated) in 2019, mothers of minor children had the lowest levels of median wealth by far, with [only about $7,000 in family wealth](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2022/may/single-mothers-slim-financial-cushions)."  
>Wealth is important for housing and food security, and financial well-being more generally, though it varies considerably by race and ethnicity. Single white mothers had $46,000 in median wealth in 2019, whereas single Black and Hispanic/Latina mothers had about $4,000. Single white mothers thus had about 11 times more median wealth, affording them a more comfortable cushion when dealing with unanticipated events like the pandemic. In 2020, Black and Hispanic/Latina women (ages 25-54) were more likely to be single mothers of children ages 0-17 than were white women; the likelihood of being such a mother was 26%, 19% and 11%, respectively.  
[https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2022/may/single-mothers-slim-financial-cushions](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2022/may/single-mothers-slim-financial-cushions)  

Changing that racial disparity, which is real and is a slice of broader long-running racism, is critically important, but is beyond the scope of this argument.  

A [recent Federal Reserve paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018080pap.pdf) documented that a very different constellation of circumstances is associated with "[millennials](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/Generations-Defined.md) own(ing) fewer assets than members of earlier generations" when they were young, with lower earnings, fewer assets, and less wealth.  

The most recent [Federal Reserve data](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) says that only 54.5 percent of Americans ages 55 to 64 have retirement accounts.  

If you find yourself a decade or more behind your peers -- or if you just fear it -- the foundational rule is to get started on a path to some type, some level of *retirement readiness.*  

|   At times throughout my adult life I have listened to peers romanticizing the lives of *the poor*, sometimes in the context of describing their expectations in *old age*.  If you **ever** find yourself doing the same, **stop**.  Living in the United States of America without having *enough money* is hard!  Our systems are built around -- among other critical dimensions -- social and economic thresholds that introduce additional tasks (*work*) and expenses (*"taxes" by other names*) for the survival of those considered "*poor*."  Being *poor* in the U.S. is exhausting and punishing, and an unsuitable *retirement* goal for most.  

Regardless of the scale of your available resources, the most important short term priority is to start building wealth.  How much wealth?  That will vary, but a commonly-repeated target remains "you need 25-times your pre-tax income portfolio goal when you retire" ([*here quoted from David M. Blanchett, Ph.D., CFA, CFP®, and more*](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2021/02/25/retirement-planning-in-the-post-4-world))," which I believe for most can safely be simplified to "your retirement investment portfolio should be 25 times the size of your annual income at retirement."  For most of us that can seem like a challenge, but try to remain engaged in your efforts to prepare for your retirement -- don't freeze up.  Research your options -- there are lots of on-line resources.  A very quick, crude, retirement savings calculator is available at: [https://www.cnn.com/business/calculators/retirement-calculator](https://www.cnn.com/business/calculators/retirement-calculator).  Make decision after decision.  Take the next step, and the next.  Here is an example of what 20 and 25-times some sample annual incomes looks like:  

|Annual Income|Times 20|Times 25|
|:-----------:|:------:|:------:|
|$20,000 | $400,000 | $500,000|
|$30,000 | $600,000 | $750,000|
|$40,000 | $800,000 | $1,000,000|
|$50,000 | $1,000,000 | $1,250,000|
|$60,000 | $1,200,000 | $1,500,000|
|$70,000 | $1,400,000 | $1,750,000|
|$80,000 | $1,600,000 | $2,000,000|
|$90,000 | $1,800,000 | $2,250,000|
|$100,000 | $2,000,000 | $2,500,000|
|$110,000 | $2,200,000 | $2,750,000|
|$120,000 | $2,400,000 | $3,000,000|
|$130,000 | $2,600,000 | $3,250,000|
|$140,000 | $2,800,000 | $3,500,000|
|$150,000 | $3,000,000 | $3,750,000|

>[*I have seen opinion pieces and research papers that replace the "Annual Income" I used above, with "Annual Spending."  There may be material distance between these two values.  "Annual Spending" **may** be a more appropriate value for some.  Use which ever seems most appropriate for your situation.*]  

Again, these numbers can seem like a challenge in isolation.  But for many who reach them, they are the result of regular *savings* for retirement and full participation in employer plans over many years.  One of the keys is to start and stick with a plan.  
*There is some disagreement about this 20x to 25x target -- the approach outlined above may not be right for everyone.  See the ["Are You Saving Enough For Retirement? At this household income:"](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/retirement/you-need-this-much-retirement-savings-at-your-age-and-income/) table in [this article](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/retirement/you-need-this-much-retirement-savings-at-your-age-and-income/) by Paul Katzeff for an alternative idea -- one that I believe materially increases one's longevity, uncertain (*medical or other*) material expenses in old age, and market timing risks.*

For many, a material component of your retirement readiness equation is your spending behaviors.  As of Q1 2022 America's household debt is around a staggering [$15.84 trillion](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html).  Be mindful, self-aware and alert.  Ask yourself, "Am I doing the right thing?"  This is especially true for your 'consumer' behaviors.  For a lot of us, asset accumulation also meant deciding how **not** to spend our money.  This does not have to involve negative self-denial.  [Some argue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living) that *[voluntary simplicity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/voluntary-simplicity.asp)* is the most approprate target.  If you can look at your own actions from the perspective of a third party who cares about meeting your retirement goals, you may be able to make consumption choices better aligned with your retirement *asset accumulation* goals.  

Also, a number of wise peers have counseled me to remember that it's never too late to learn, and asking a question is often more important than *knowing* the answer.  [Thank you Pranav Doctor.](https://blog.avenuecode.com/ac-spotlight-pranava-doctor)  

There will be some uncertainty.  It is not unusual to find your inner voice asking: "How did I end up here?" or "What am I doing with my investments?" or even "Why did I ever agree to this?"  There is no magic for dealing with these issues.  Talk with people you trust.  Learn about your options for managing your money, saving and investing.  And, as needed, adapt.  

There are some useful tools and information at: SEC Investor.gov Publications and Research (includes financial tools and calculators) [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/publications-and-research](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/publications-and-research).  

How do you know your plan is working?  Identify and then start documenting some dimensions of that plan.  Tracking Savings habits, credit card (or other high-interest) debt, emergency savings[Note 4](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/How-can-you-prepare-for-retirement.md#NOTES), and asset portfolio size-and-risk might be useful measures for determining the succcess of your plan.  

Your financial planner will take your information, run a set of Monte-Carlo (or other) simulations, and report on the probability of your plan and your behaviors against that plan, meeting goal(s) that define **your** successful financial outcome(s) at an older age.  

When you approach or enter *retirement,* your willingness to assume risks in equity, commodity, or other markets may evaporate [[*this might be changing*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/business/retirement-stocks-vanguard.html)].  It is a challenge, though, to generate an adequate income stream using only the safest of financial instruments (cash, or near-cash equivalents). ...And [bond funds don't deliver predictable returns (*like they used to*)](https://www.deshaw.com/research/market-insight-revisiting-stock-bond-correlation).  Safety does not pay today[Note 5](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/How-can-you-prepare-for-retirement.md#NOTES) -- you may receive less than one half of one percent interest in your local bank.  As a reality check, you can easily review how much *annual income* a given pile of financial assets can reliably generate in these extremely low interest rate times.  *Storing* your money in cash or equivalents will generally deliver stability, but with a relatively low return.  See the table below:  

|Assets| 1.0% | 1.25%| 1.5% | 1.75%| 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% | 3.5% | 4.0% | 4.5% | 5.0% | 5.5% | 6.0% |

Some individuals and families have retirement cash flow expectations of $150,000/yr, $200,000/yr, $300,000/yr, and some even more.  I included some *big* numbers in the Assets column to help demonstrate the scale of preparation required to support income streams like that.  I read that too often, individuals spending at these levels in retirement have not constructed the required financial foundation, and burn through material portions of their retirement funds before aknowledging that situation -- leaving them seriously financially challenged for the duration of their life.  Not where any of us want to land.  

Those upper rows refer to material wealth.  Who has that kind of money?[[Note 6](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/How-can-you-prepare-for-retirement.md#NOTES)]  Most don't.  While there have been recent wage increases, [over the past 40 years wages have stagnated against the cost of living for most Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/).  And the proportion of the U.S. population who have accumulated $1.2 million or more has shrunk and the distance between the median wealth and entry into the top 9.9% has more than doubled in the last 6 decades.   
In "The 9.9 Percent," Matthew Stewart noted that in 1963, the median household would have needed 10 times as much wealth to reach the middle of the (*top*) 9.9 percent. Today, it would need 24 times as much wealth. 
He also reported that it took $2.4 million in assets to reach the the 9.9 percent group's median...  
Quoted from a review by Eyal Press: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/books/review/the-99-percent-matthew-stewart.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/books/review/the-99-percent-matthew-stewart.html)  The U.S. Federal Reserve reports](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:0;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:1,5,7;units:shares;range:1989.3,2021.3) that the top 1% of of Americans by accumulated wealth own over a third of all wealth in the country (roughly the same amount as the bottom 90%), while the bottom 50% own about 2.5% of all wealth.  Those are just facts.  They document the distribution of wealth -- that by almost any measure seems unfair.  They do not, though, alter the ruthless impacts of time and aging that require planning for *old age* and whatever will be your retirement.  

Once you *retire* and begin drawing from your accumulated assets, it is also important to consider the tax of your various options.  Withdrawals from defined-contribution plans like some types of IRAs and 401(k)s are taxable at your federal level, based on your income. Withdrawals from taxable brokerage accounts are subject to capital gains tax on investment profits.  Withdrawals from an Roth IRA is not taxable if you are at least 59 1/2, as long as you have kept the money in the Roth IRA account for at least five years.


## Guaranteed Income and the Nature of Your Needs May Impact Investment Withdrawl Rates During Retirement  

The model below is from an AARP Bulletin retelling of "The impact of Guaranteed Income and Dynamic Withdrawals on Safe Initial Withdrawal Rates" by David Blanchett, as well as my reading of the same.  

### Share of your financial resources composed of guaranteed income  

To use the table below, gather the following information:  
1. My annual guaranteed retirement income is: ________ [Social Security + any other source like an annuity or pension]  

2. My net worth is: ________ [real assets (*bank + investment balances + home equity + any-others*) minus debt (*of all types*)]  

3. My total financial resources are: ________ [Add the values in #s 1 and 2 above -- guaranteed income current value plus net worth]  

4. Calculate the share (%) of your total financial resources that is guaranteed income: ________ [divide guaranteed income by total financial resources]  

5. My percentage of spending that is nondiscretionary: ______ [spending that I cannot change - stuff like housing, health care, for some even food]  
Some portion of consumption/spending is sometimes discretionary.  In the United States, that is not the norm for every retiree.  David Blanchett argues that "Most retirees will likely have a retirement income goal that will support a combination of discretionary and nondiscretionary needs.  In other words, retirees are generally able to adjust some aspects of consumption, but not necessarily all aspects (at least without a significant degree of pain).  For example, some expenses may be relatively fixed in nature, such as housing and health care, while others can more easily be adjusted, such as entertainment and transportation, and still others may be a combination of the two, like food."  

6. Finally, find the squares on the table below at the intersection of your "Share of your financial resources composed of guaranteed income" and the percentage of your spending that is nondiscretionary.  
                                                                    % of guaranteed income of your financial resources  
                                                                          
|% nondiscretionary| 5% |25% |50% |75% | 95%|  
|:----------------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|  
|0%|2.4%|3.6%|4.4%|5.1%|6.9%|  
|25%|2.4%|3.5%|4.2%|5.0%|6.8%|  
|50%|2.4%|3.3%|4.0%|4.8%|6.6%|  
|75%|2.2%|3.1%|3.8%|4.7%|6.4%|  
|100%|2.0%|2.1%|3.6%|4.5%|6.3%|  

The *percent of guaranteed income* columns represent what David Blanchett's calculations estimate how much his model predicts that you can withdraw in your first year of retirement.  The annual amount is then indexed upward to match inflation.  


### Plan for what your retirement will be  
Here is an essay that will help you get started thinking: ["How to Enjoy Retirement Without Going Broke"](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/opinion/how-to-enjoy-retirement-without-going-broke.html), By Petter Coy, 2021-08-28,   


### What About Those FIRE -- *financial independence, retire early* -- Promoters?  
Achieving financial independence *early* is an attractive dream.  For many, the **FIRE** -- *financial independence, retire early* -- movement is linked to to the [1992 book "Your Money or Your Life"](https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/history/) by Joseph Dominguez and Vicki Robin.  I highly recommend checking it out of your local library and reading it, but there are many origin stories for living simply while preparing for *your* financial and personal well being in the future.  There is no magic in this community.  They generally require extreme savings over long periods of time and materially constrained spending until you die.  This lifestyle is not for everyone.

#### NOTES  
**Note 1**:  Unfortunately, planning for and building a formal retirement plan is an unattainable luxury for too many people in the United States.  In March 2022 the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statics reported that 65% [of civilian workers had some access to medical care and retirement benefits with 71% of them participating -- (*24% defined benefit and 55% defined contribution*)](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2022/home.htm), see the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statics' [2010 – 2022 historical Excel dataset (XLSX)](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/xlsx/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-dataset.xlsx).  That leaves ~35% of American civilian workers access to employer sponsored medical care and retirement benefits.  [In 2019 families with the lowest 25% of net worths in the U.S.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf20.pdf)[page 10], had a median (the middle value in the data set) income of $29,900, and mean (average) income of $37,900 -- leaving little *excess* for saving/investing.  [Systemic and cultural barriers constrain opportunities for some](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm), especially those most impacted by America's original sin of slavery.  Also see: [https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/december/has-wealth-inequality-changed-over-time-key-statistics](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/december/has-wealth-inequality-changed-over-time-key-statistics), and [https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2022/may/single-mothers-slim-financial-cushions](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2022/may/single-mothers-slim-financial-cushions).  I understand some of these abstract facts but don't understand the nature and scope of societal evolution that could eliminate this curse -- the [Washington Center for Equitable Growth](https://equitablegrowth.org/who-we-are/) offers [some policy ideas](https://equitablegrowth.org/policy-prescriptions-for-the-flawed-and-unequal-retirement-savings-systems-that-perpetuate-u-s-economic-inequality/).  
**Note 2**: Cryptocurrency (crypto), a large, complex, evolving universe decentralized digital currencies and infrastructure, seems misaligned with **most** of our retirement wealth accumulation and income generation needs.  Cryptocurrencies play a material role in criminal activity across the globe.  Cryptocurrency exchanges tend to resist participation in '*know your customer*' and other crime-resisting measures.  More than a few cryptocurrency platforms have suffered large-scale losses.  [Hostile parties stole at least US$3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2021, and in the first three months of 2022 they have stolen another US$1.3 billion](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-defi-hacks/).  Cryptocurrency mining and use of underlying blockchain technology for *recorkeeping* seem excessively energy consumptive (i.e., *environmentally destructive*). Administering transactions via blockchain technology can, at an operational level remain largely opaque and introduces a spectrum of fees that aren't itemized in traditional financial services (leading to surprises for too many).  The lifecycles of some cryptocurrencies have appeared to be little more than unregulated pump-and-dump, digital grifter schemes.  There are also [newer entrants into this crypto marketplace](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/06/women-crypto-nft/) preying on other's fear of missing out.  [Paul Krugman argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/opinion/cryptocurrency-subprime-vulnerable.html) that "there's growing evidence that the risks of crypto are falling disproportionately on people who don't know what they are getting into and are poorly positioned to handle the downside."  I recognize that cryptocurrencies have generated returns for some, but that I believe it would be an investment mistake to draw too many parallels with more traditional forms of investing and units of wealth accumulation.  As of Q2 2022, I do not view cryptocurrency as a **material** component in any risk-reasonable retirement portfolio (except for those who maintain large-scale multi-generational wealth, where it may have a place in their diversification program).  See: [https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-are-legal-risks-cryptocurrency-investors/](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-are-legal-risks-cryptocurrency-investors/), [https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/cryptocurrency-risks-to-your-institution-and-the-regulatory-landscape/](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/cryptocurrency-risks-to-your-institution-and-the-regulatory-landscape/), and *a little dated* [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dantedisparte/2018/07/21/beware-of-crypto-risks-10-risks-to-watch/?sh=1b5fd7d5f17f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dantedisparte/2018/07/21/beware-of-crypto-risks-10-risks-to-watch/?sh=1b5fd7d5f17f).  
Also, hostile nations use cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions and industry practices and rhetoric seem too often to support this activity under the general frame of "*freedom*."  In the context of the Russian (*Putin's*) war to crush Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, and annex Ukraine's territory as it's own [some *boosters* are highlighting cryptocurrency as a tool for sanctions-dodgers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/06/russia-ukraine-war-news-putin-live-updates/#link-DMXOOTU5YBAGJK7LEP676M4VVY) -- which seems like a useful real-world example of a mis-use case.  This is **real** war of aggression -- doing what this type of agression has always done, industrial-scale murder, destruction of physical and operational infrastructure, along with destruction of industrial, agricultural, and social governance capacity, and individual human and collective suffering on a national scale -- laying waste to a democratic nation of 43 million people.  Highlighting cryptocurrencies as a way to support portions of the Russian war-time economy (*while generating profits for cryptocurrency insiders*) is by any measure not something for *normal* economic market participants or for supporters of democracy and human decency.  North Korea (*Democratic People's Republic of Korea*) steals money to help fund its nuclear arms activities.  One of its hacking teams called the Lazarus Group, recently stole around $620 million in cryptocurrency Ethereum from the video game Axie Infinity (*the hackers infiltrated part of the underlying blockchain that powers the game, Ronin*) after stealing nearly $400 million in cryptocurrency in 2021.

**Note 3**: If you are going to use a financial advisor, think about the importance of choosing one who must maintain your *best interest* in all investment decision-making -- one covered by the 'Best Interest' Obligation [Rule 15/-1](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-240/subject-group-ECFR64f52d737aea1ed/section-240.15l-1) under the [Securities and Exchange Act of 1934](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-240?toc=1).  Full (770 page) 'Regulation Best Interest' Effective September 10, 2019 [https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2019/34-86031.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2019/34-86031.pdf).  Investment advisor disclosures can be hard to read.  Here is an example of how one financial advisor discloses this 'Regulation Best Interest' information: [https://wfa.com/crs/regbi-wfcs](https://wfa.com/crs/regbi-wfcs)    
**Note 4**: It is hard to exaggerate the need for some money set aside for an unexpected expense or a financial market shock (*and the challenges that presents for some, see NOTE 1 above*).  [Robert Powell reported](https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com?selDate=20220403&goTo=D003&artid=0) that according to a recent Society of Actuaries survey: 
"When asked what they could afford to spend out of pocket on an emergency without jeopardizing their retirement security, half of pre-retirees report that they could only afford to spend $10,000 or less and more than half of retirees could afford no more than $25,000. Black/African American pre-retirees (61%) are more likely than pre-retirees in general (40%) to be impacted by an unexpected expense of up to $10,000.  Among retirees, Black/African American respondents (58%) and Hispanic/ Latino (52%) said they are not able to spend $10,000 without it affecting their retirement security. This was much greater than the general retiree response (32%), according to the Society of Actuaries survey.  Most financial planners recommend that you have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside for, well, emergencies or financial shocks, such as a new roof or dental work."  That is a lot of money, but essential to weather the types of *surprises* that are a virtual certainty at one time or another.  Roger Whitney, host of the "Retirement Answer Man" pod-cast advised that when unexpected spending shocks "happen in retirement – after income from work ends – they aren't as easily absorbed or worked through.  To be better prepared, create options for your future self to deal with a shock. Building cash reserves above a normal emergency fund, eliminating debt to lower fixed monthly payments, or working part time can help create financial slack to help you be agile as your retirement life unfolds."  Similarly, the [Willis Towers Watson's "2022 Global Benefits Attitudes Survey"](https://www.wtwco.com/en-US/Insights/2022/07/infographic-half-of-us-employees-face-retirement-risks) (*35,549 employees from large and midsize private employers in 23 markets participated in the WTW survey*) concluded that "half of employees face key risks to their retirement security:"  
  * 35 percent of millennial workers were *undersaving* -- saving only 5 percent or less of their income  
  * 18 percent -- *of those with a defined contribution plan* -- had taken a loan from their 401(k)  
  * 20 percent had withdrawn funds from their 401(k). Yet, 52 percent said they expected to retire before 65  
  I understand (*see NOTE 1 above*) that serious emergency savings may not be practical for everyone, but keep it in whatever planning you establish.  
**Note 5**: I am aware of what *may be* at least one long term *exception* -- U.S. [Series I Savings Bonds](https://treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ibuy.htm).  They are inflation indexed and were [paying 9.62% in the period May 1, 2022 to October 31, 2022](https://treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm#irate).  See: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm) as well as a couple articles for context at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/03/inflation-government-i-savings-bonds/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/03/inflation-government-i-savings-bonds/) and [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/20/buying-inflation-indexed-i-bonds/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/20/buying-inflation-indexed-i-bonds/)
