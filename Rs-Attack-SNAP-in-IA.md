# New SNAP & Medicaid 'Program Itegrity' Measures Build-In Material IT, Operational and Security Challenges  

In the first week of the 2023 Iowa legislative session 38 Republican legislators introduced [House File 3](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF3&ga=90) targeting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  

The Iowa Dept of Human Services (HHS) [describes their SNAP mission](https://dhs.iowa.gov/food-assistance) as providing:  
>"nutrition benefits to supplement the food budget of needy families so they can purchase healthy food and move towards self-sufficiency."  

The Iowa Hunger Coalition has an exemplary and detailed review of the many ways that this proposed legislation will "result in taking food away from children," contrary to the stated HHS mission statement for SNAP.  See their excellent work at:

In addition to limiting food choices (*and more*), this bill adds new data collection and data matching requirements for both SNAP and Medicaid applicants, as well as for current enrollees in both programs and additional identity verification measures.  Legislators require the IOWA HHS to acquire and use all the data listed in the **New Data Requirements** section below.  This will be a material and expensive program management, application development, data management, training and ongoing operations challenge -- one that seems likely to result in material errors and omissions that diminish the effectiveness of all other efforts to achieve the stated SNAP & Medicaid missions.  These new requirements seem designed to result in additional suffering across populations who are -- in principle -- supposed to receive SNAP and Medicaid assistance at any given time.  

Concentrating detailed and comprehensive data about Iowans into systems/services required by Iowa Law, and then expanding the number and range of personnel requiring access to that data is a sure path to enhancing the security risks that Iowans must manage.  That information security risk management is not cheap and this new law will add materially to the cost of State government operations.  Periodically responding to information security breaches (*because they **will** occur*) will also impose new and hard-to-predict expenses on State government and new workloads on State government personnel.  


### New Data Requirements / New Data Matching Challenges  
a. Death records. On at least a monthly basis, information from the department including but not limited to death records.  
b. Employment information. On at least a quarterly basis, information from the department of workforce development including but not limited to changes in employment or wages.  
c. Residency information. On at least a monthly basis, information including but not limited to potential changes in residency as identified by out-of-state electronic benefit transfer transactions.  
d. Incarceration information. On at least a monthly basis, information from the department of corrections.  

**2. State records —— households.** The department shall receive and review all of the following information concerning individuals in households enrolled in the supplemental nutrition assistance program that indicates a change in circumstances that may affect eligibility:  
a. Tax information. On at least a quarterly basis, information from the department of revenue including but not limited to potential changes in income, wages, or residency as identified by tax records.  
b. Unemployment information. On at least a semi-monthly basis, information from the department of workforce development including but not limited to potential changes in employment, income, or assets.  
***then add the following for applicants to and recipients of the Iowa Medicaid program:**  
a. Death records. On at least a monthly basis, information from the department including but not limited to death records.  
b. Employment information. On at least a quarterly basis, information from the department of workforce development including but not limited to changes in employment or wages.  
c. Residency information. On at least a monthly basis, information including but not limited to potential changes in residency as identified by out-of-state electronic benefit transfer transactions.  

**3. Federal records —— households.** The department shall cross-check information relating to individuals in households enrolled in the supplemental nutrition assistance program with federal databases including but not limited to all of the following, on at least a monthly basis:  
a. Earned income information, death register information, incarceration records, supplemental security income information, beneficiary records, earnings information, and pension information maintained by the United States social security administration.  
b. Income and employment information maintained in the national directory of new hires database and child support enforcement data maintained by the United States department of health and human services.  
c. Payment and earnings information maintained by the United States department of housing and urban development.  
d. National fleeing felon information maintained by the United States federal bureau of investigation.  

**3. Real-time record review —— applicants.** Prior to determining the eligibility of an applicant for Medicaid, the department shall access information for every member of the applicant’s household from the data sources specified in this section and shall conduct a review of nationwide public records data sources of physical asset ownership. The nationwide public records data sources may include but are not limited to records of real property and automobiles, watercraft, aircraft, luxury vehicles, and any other vehicles owned by the applicant.  

**4. Residency information —— applicants.** Prior to determining the eligibility of an applicant for Medicaid, the department shall require proof of residency from the applicant. (*Note: ...which seems to imply an already-required definition: "as identified by out-of-state electronic benefit 8 transfer transactions."*)  




### The bill also introduces additional/new identity *verification* requirements (Section 2) 
>...prior to the department awarding public assistance benefits, an applicant shall complete a computerized identity authentication process to confirm the identity of the applicant. Identity authentication shall be accomplished through a knowledge-based questionnaire consisting of financial and personal questions.
